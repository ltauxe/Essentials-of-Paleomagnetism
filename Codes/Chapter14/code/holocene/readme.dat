Thee data in alldat are the time series represented by PSVMOD1.0
and discussed in detail in Lund & Constable 1999. The time series come
from 24 globally distributed sites, and are modelled declination and
or inclination at 100 year intervals.

Sample format of the file alldat is suitbale for input into Occam
inversion code maintained at SIO and is as follows:

1 35 -110 57.700 0 0 2.5 -1.0000 0 0 2.5 1600.0

Column 1: No of measurements - always 1 here
column 2: Site latitude - degrees
column 3: site longitude - degrees
column 4: inclination 
column 5: dummy
column 6: dummy
column 7: estimated uncertainty in inclination (1 s.d.)
column 8: declination
column 9: dummy
column 10: dummy
column 11: estimated uncertainty in declination (1 s.d.)
column 12: age of record - positive is years AD, negative BC.

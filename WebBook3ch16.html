<!--l. 6--><p class="nopar" >BACKGROUND: read McElhinny and McFadden (2000).
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >No book on paleomagnetism would be complete without a chapter on apparent
polar wander and tectonic applications of paleomagnetism. So what is apparent
polar wander? The simple notion of a centered dipole giving rise to an observed
direction at an observation point on the surface of the Earth led to the definition
of an equivalent pole position, the VGP of Chapter 2. In Chapter 14 we
mentioned that averages of a number of VGPs sufficient to &#8220;average
out&#8221; secular variation are known as paleomagnetic poles. When these
are plotted on a map, they tend to &#8220;wander&#8221; away from the spin axis
with increasing age of the rock unit sampled (e.g, Hospers, 1955; Irving,
1958).
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >As illustrated in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-1950011">16.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:wandering --></a>, the apparent wandering of the north pole could be
interpreted in two ways: wandering of continents whose paleomagnetic directions
reflect the changing orientations and distances to the (fixed) pole (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-1950011">16.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:wandering --></a>a),
or alternatively, the pole itself could be wandering, as in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-1950011">16.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:wandering --></a>b while the
continent remains fixed. Data from a single continent cannot distinguish between
these two hypotheses. But data from multiple continents and a firm belief in the
essential dipolar nature of the geomagnetic field (dating back to 1600!)
can. If the pole paths from two or more continents diverge back in time
and there is a dipolar field (only one north pole), then it must be the
continents that are doing the wandering. It was data of this kind that
convinced paleomagnetists in the 50s of the reality of continental drift. In
this chapter we will consider how apparent polar wander paths for the
various continents can be constructed and briefly discuss a few tectonic
applications.

<!--l. 33--><p class="nopar" >Well after the concept of continental drift and apparent polar wander had been
accepted by most of the paleomagnetic community, the idea of sea-floor spreading
and plate tectonics was developed to explain it. In plate tectonics, the hard
outer shell of the Earth, the <span

semi-rigid plates, the most important of which are shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a

These plates are in constant motion with respect to one another. The
relative motion of two plates can be described by rotation about an Euler
rotation vector, which is usually specified by a pole latitude/longitude
on the surface of the Earth (<span

<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >Euler poles describe instantaneous rates of rotation of one plate or continental
fragment with respect to another. Often, what is known is not the rate, but the
total rotation about a given pole that restores a plate to some prior state (see
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-1960033">16.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:finrot --></a>a.) Such a pole is called a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">finite rotation pole</span>. These can be found in
several ways. Transforms and ridges define plate boundaries between two
lithospheric plates and are to first order perpendicular and parallel to the
direction of the finite rotation pole respectively. Marine magnetic anomalies can
also be restored to the spreading centers via finite rotations. Also, a finite
rotation can be found that restores a position defined for example by the
continental margins (e.g., the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Bullard fit </span>of the Atlantic bordering continents,
Bullard et al., 1965) or that maximizes agreement of paleomagnetic poles after
rotation.
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >Tremendous effort has been put into compiling finite rotations for various
lithospheric plates through time. The most recent and comprehensive
compilation is that of Torsvik et al. (2008), which goes back more than 300
Myr. Reconstructions for the last 200 Ma are based mostly on marine
geophysical data like marine magnetic anomalies, spreading center and
transform azimuths, etc. Pressing back in time, we run out of sea-floor when
the Atlantic Ocean is completely closed and finite rotations between
blocks must be constrained in other ways, for example, fit of geological
observations or paleomagnetic poles. Therefore finite rotations for times
prior to about 200 Ma are not independent of the paleomagnetic pole
data themselves. Nonetheless, they provide a useful straw man frame of
reference. We include a partial list of finite rotations in Appendix&#x00A0;<a

because such a context exists, but in the Precambrian and early Paleozoic, the

of APWP: selection of poles which can be considered &#8220;reliable&#8221; and curve
fitting.
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >Picking out the meaningful poles from the published data is part of the art of
paleomagnetism. We have been building a tool kit for dealing with this problem
throughout this book. There is some agreement in what constitutes a &#8220;good&#8221;
pole among various workers. The general selection criteria used by most
paleomagnetists are based on those summarized by van der Voo (1990;V90).
They have been modified for particular applications, for example, by Besse and
Courtillot (2002; BC02) as noted in the following.

     on many assumptions as to what the magnitude of secular variation

<!--l. 319--><p class="nopar" >Besse and Courtillot (2002) produced a master path for the last 200 Myr and
Torsvik et al. (2008) refined the poles of rotation and extended them back to 320
Ma. Prior to about 200 Ma, however, rotation poles are more difficult to
constrain, independent of the paleomagnetic data themselves. Both the quality
and quantity of the available poles decline with increasing age. The assumptions
of the GAD hypothesis and amount and style of secular variation become
increasingly problematic. Furthermore, most continents are composed of
separate blocks whose relationships in ancient times are unknown or
poorly known. Exceptions to this are supercontinents like Gondwana for
which it is possible to combine data from different blocks with some
confidence.
<!--l. 324--><p class="noindent" >Gondwana was a supercontinent that coalesced about 550 Ma and was
incorporated into a larger supercontinent of Pangea during the Carboniferous.
Pangea itself began breaking up during the Mid-Jurassic when the Atlantic
                                                                     

                                                                     
Ocean began to form. The core continental fragments that comprise Gondwana
are NE, NW and Southern Africa, South America, Madagascar, Greater India,
Cratonic Australia and East Antarctica. Torsvik and van der Voo (2002)
compiled a list of paleomagnetic poles from these core parts of the Gondwana
continents (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">Q </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x2265; </span>3 for the V90 criteria) along with a set of finite rotation poles for
putting them back together.

complicated in the Mesozoic and the poles are sparse prior to about 250
Ma leading to the suspicion that the path is somewhat undersampled.
By rotating poles from all the Gondwana continental fragments into
South African coordinates and fitting them with a smoothed path using
splines, Torsvik and van der Voo (2002) produced the APWP shown in
Figure&#x00A0;<a

indigenous poles become more sparse and more poorly dated and reconstruction

some authors have pushed their interpretations of Cambrian data reach rather
extreme conclusions. For example, large swings in the APWP for Australia led to
the conclusion that the entire spin axis of the Earth changed by 90<sup><span

<!--l. 357--><p class="nopar" >One of the most useful, in fact essential, assumptions in paleomagnetism is that
the geomagnetic field is on average closely approximated by a geocentric axial
dipole (GAD). As discussed in Chapter 14, the GAD hypothesis has been found
to be nearly true for at least the last 5 million years with the largest non-GAD
contribution to the spherical harmonic expansion generally being of the order of
5%. For the more ancient past, it is difficult to test the GAD (or any other field)
hypothesis owing to plate motions, accumulating problems of overprinting, and
difficulty in reconstructing paleo-horizontal. Although most paleomagnetic
studies make the implicit assumption of a GAD field, several recent studies
have called the essential GAD nature of the ancient field into question.
These studies fall into two groups: those that use reference poles and
plate tectonic reconstructions to predict directions (e.g., Si and van der
Voo, 2001) and those that compare observed statistical distributions of
directions to those predicted by different field models (e.g., Kent and
Smethurst, 1998; van der Voo and Torsvik, 2001). The inescapable conclusion
from these and other studies is that there is often a strong bias toward
shallow inclinations and many studies have called on non-dipole field
contributions, in particular large (up to 20%) average zonal octupole (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">g</span><sub><span

<!--l. 378--><p class="noindent" >From Chapter 14 we know that paleomagnetic directions from the last
five million years are, if anything, elongate in the North-South vertical
plane. However, sedimentary inclination flattening not only results in
directions that are too shallow, but also reduces N-S elongations in favor of
elongations that are more east-west. This effect is shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a

the flattening factor ranging from unity (no flattening) to 0 (completely

Figure&#x00A0;<a

shallowing from others, for example, poleward plate motion which leaves the
                                                                     

                                                                     
distribution unchanged or non-dipole field effects. Zonal non-dipole field
contributions like those from axial quadrupole or octupole fields make the
distribution more elongate in the meridional plane (see, e.g., Tauxe and Kent,

<!--l. 533--><p class="nopar" >In addition to defining finite rotations for reconstruction, paleomagnetic poles
can be used as an independent test of proposed reconstructions based on other
observations. After reconstructing continental fragments according to some
hypothesized set of finite rotations, one can assess whether the paleomagnetic
poles are consistent with such a reconstruction. Are the poles better clustered in
one reconstruction as opposed to another? Do poles from separate continental
blocks fall on top of each other after reconstruction? If the paleomagnetic poles
are not well clustered, then there must be something wrong with the
poles themselves, the reconstruction, or the GAD hypothesis; arguments
about particular reconstructions revolve around all three of these issues.
As an example of the role of paleomagnetic poles in paleogeographic
reconstructions, we consider the case of Pangea, a topic of debate for over three
decades.
<!--l. 538--><p class="noindent" >Many people who have contemplated the globe have had the desire to fit North
and South America against Europe and Africa by closing the Atlantic Ocean.
One such attempt, known as the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Bullard fit </span>(Bullard et al., 1965), fits the
continents together using minimization of misfits (gaps and overlaps) of a
particular contour on the continental shelves as the primary criterion. This
reconstruction (extended by Smith and Hallam, 1970) has come to be called the
Pangea A (also known as A-1) fit and is shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-19900213">16.13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pangea --></a>a. There is little
controversy over this fit as the starting point for the opening of the Atlantic in
the Jurassic. The fit is strongly supported by paleomagnetic data as
shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-19900514">16.14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pangea-poles --></a>a in which we plot poles from the time period
spanning 180 to 200 Ma from the lists of Besse and Courtillot (2002) and
Torsvik et al. (2008). These poles have been rotated into the Pangea A
reference frame using the poles of rotation listed in Table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-1990032">16.2<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:pangea --></a> for each
continent.
<!--l. 559--><p class="noindent" >The ink was scarcely dry on the Smith and Hallam (1970) version of Pangea A
when paleomagnetists began exploring its limits. Van der Voo and French (1974)
pointed out that data from the older parts of Gondwana (Paleozoic to perhaps
Early Triassic) did not fit as well as the younger parts. We show poles from the
Permian (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>250-300 Ma) compiled by Torsvik et al. (2008) in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-19900514">16.14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pangea-poles --></a>b after
rotation to the Pangea A frame of reference. The poles are more scattered
and there is a systematic separation of poles from Gondwana continents
relative to those from Laurasia. Van der Voo and French (1974) modified
the Pangea A fit (Pangea A-2) which improved the clustering of the
                                                                     

                                                                     
poles (see Figures&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-19900213">16.13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pangea --></a>b and &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-19900514">16.14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pangea-poles --></a>c.) An entirely different solution was
proposed by Irving (1977) and Morel and Irving (1981), known as Pangea B
(see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-19900213">16.13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pangea --></a>). This fit takes advantage of the non-uniqueness of
longitude in paleomagnetic reconstructions and slides North America to
the west of South America. The resulting pole distribution is shown in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-19900514">16.14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pangea-poles --></a>d. Pangea B must then transform to Pangea A at some
point before the opening of the Atlantic. Muttoni et al. (2003) advocated
a reconstruction much like Pangea B and suggested that it began to
evolve toward Pangea A-2 by the mid Permian. In Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-19900514">16.14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pangea-poles --></a>e, we
show poles from just the lower Permian (285-300 Ma). While the (lower)
Permian poles from most continents do agree with the Pangea B fit, those
from Europe (red dots) are significantly offset. Interestingly, the North
American poles do not agree with the European poles either, so there
must be some problem in the reconstruction of Laurasia in the Pangea B
reconstruction.

the reference pole of the APWP may have rotated or translated from their
original positions as independent entities (as tectonostratigraphic terranes or

America, it soon became apparent that many of the poles were well off the
beaten track for the rest of the plate (see, e.g., Irving, 1979). To illustrate this,
we plot the data from North America that meet minimum V90 standards
(<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">Q &#x003E; </span>2). The mean poles from &#8220;cratonic&#8221; North America (from van der Voo,
1990) are plotted as circles in Figure&#x00A0;<a

discordant poles do not fall anywhere near the APWP. Most are from
western North America and indicate some clockwise rotations (the poles are
rotated to the right of the expected poles). When taking into account the
age of the formations, many also seem to have directions that are too
shallow, which suggests possible northward transport of 1000s of kilometers.
The validity and meaning of these discordant directions is still under
debate, but it is obvious that most of the western Cordillera is not <span

Tauxe et al. (1983b) to help constrain the motion of the African plate
during the Cenozoic and subsequent compilations have continued the
practice (see, e.g. Besse and Courtillot, 2002). Van der Voo (1992) used
data from &#8220;mobile belts&#8221; that experienced relative rotation with respect
to the craton to provide constraints on the Jurassic APWP of North
America, a subject of some contention (see, e.g. Van Fossen and Kent, 1990;
Butler et al., 1992; Van Fossen and Kent, 1992, 1993). We re-do the
analysis for one specific time window (<span

technique.

paleomagnetic poles from North America (see Figure&#x00A0;<a

Jurassic poles (labelled &#8220;G&#8221;,&#8220;K&#8221;, etc. in the figure) were interpreted to fall along
small circle segments generated by North American steady plate motion around
several Euler poles. The steady motion, represented by the two tracks labelled
&#8220;J1&#8221; and &#8220;J2&#8221; in the figure are separated by a &#8220;cusp&#8221; when the Euler pole

first-order interpretation of the data shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a

the poles may have come from portions of the North American continent that
had suffered differential rotation (see Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x18-20100016.6">16.6<!--tex4ht:ref: sect:discord --></a>) and they produced a second
set of curves that assumed different amounts of rotation for different poles. Some
poles may suffer from sedimentary inclination shallowing as well (see
Chapter 7). In the end, the APWP must agree with all the &#8220;reliable&#8221; poles
from the continent and the PEP version of the North American APWP
did not agree with several poles from the North American continent
considered highly reliable. It also disagreed with poles that had been
rotated into North American coordinates (see, e.g., Van Fossen and Kent,

data set by allowing data from regions of possible local rotation with
respect to the craton using the inclination only technique. There are many
magnetostratigraphic data sets from the Jurassic spanning the Kimmeridgian
from Italy (Channell et al. 1984; 1992; Vandenberg and Wonders, 1976), Spain
(Ogg et al. 1984) and the Colorado Plateau (Steiner and Helsley, 1975). Italy was
once part of Africa, Spain is attached to Europe (after closing of the Bay of
Biscay) and the Colorado Plateau is part of the North American continent. All
are known or suspected to have experienced relative rotation with respect to
their respective cratonic reference frames. In addition, there are data from
igneous outcrops in Lebanon (Gregor et al. 1974; van Dongen et al., 1967) and
Chile (Randall et al. 1996) that have been dated as 150-155 Ma in age.
Lebanon is part of Africa and Chile, part of South America. Note that we
have not used the data of Irwin et al. (1987) because the directions are
indistinguishable from the present field and those from Forsythe and Chisolm
(1994) because the normal and reverse data were not antipodal. There are a few
poles available from stable regions with ages between 140 and 160 Ma,
some of which were included in the compilation of Besse and Courtillot
(2002). Details of the Jurassic data sets considered here are listed in

quite a few paleomagnetic data available, albeit not all from volcanics

included in compilations such as Besse and Courtillot (2002) or Torsvik et

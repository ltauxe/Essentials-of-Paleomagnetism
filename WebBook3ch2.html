<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >One of the major efforts in paleomagnetism has been to study ancient
geomagnetic fields. Because human measurements extend back about a
millenium, measurement of &#8220;accidental&#8221; records provided by archaeological or
geological materials remains the only way to investigate ancient field behavior.
Therefore it is useful for students of paleomagnetism to understand something
about the present geomagnetic field. In this chapter we review the general
properties of the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   The part of the geomagnetic field of interest to paleomagnetists is
generated by convection currents in the liquid outer core of the Earth
which is composed of iron, nickel and some unkown lighter component(s).
The source of energy for this convection is not known for certain, but is
thought to be partly from cooling of the core and partly from the bouyancy
of the iron/nickel liquid outer core caused by freezing out of the pure
iron inner core. Motions of this conducting fluid are controlled by the
bouyancy of the liquid, the spin of the Earth about its axis and by the
interaction of the conducting fluid with the magnetic field (in a horribly
non-linear fashion). Solving the equations for the fluid motions and resulting
magnetic fields is a challenging computational task. Recent numerical
models, however, show that such magnetohydrodynamical systems can
produce self-sustaining dynamos which create enormous external magnetic
fields.

<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >The magnetic field of a dipole aligned along the spin axis and centered
in the Earth (a so-called <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">geocentric axial dipole</span>, or GAD) is shown in
Figure&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">??</span>a. [See Chapter 1 for a derivation of how to find the radial and
tangential components of such a field.] By convention, the sign of the
Earth&#8217;s dipole is negative, pointing toward the south pole as shown in
Figure&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">??</span>a and magnetic field lines point toward the north pole. They
point downward in the northern hemisphere and upward in the southern
hemisphere.

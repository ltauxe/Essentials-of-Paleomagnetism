\chapter{Problems for Essentials of Paleomagnetism: Fifth Web Edition}

The problems in this book are intended to be solved with Jupyter Notebooks in conjunction with the PmagPy software of \nocite{tauxe16} Tauxe et al., (2016).  To  get ready for this, you must do the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Install Anaconda Python 3, following the instructions in the  \href{http://earthref.org/PmagPy} {PmagPy Cookbook} in the Section on  \href{http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#getting_python}{ Full PmagPy Install}.  Be sure to include the non-default Python packages. 
\item Install PmagPy following the instructions for \href{\href{http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#pip_install}{pip install} from the command line.   
\item  Move the data files to a directory convenient to you (e.g., your Desktop) following the instructions in the \href{http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#move_data_files}.  
\end{enumerate}


The problems at the end of each chapter assume proficiency in both Python programming and the use of Jupyter notebooks.   See \href{https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ltauxe/Python-for-Earth-Science-Students/blob/master/Lecture_01_syllabus.ipynb}{Python Programming  for Earth Scientists} for a complete course.   
All the data files referred to in the Problems Section at the end of each Chapter can be found in the data\_files directory under the Essentials\_Examples directory and the solutions are available in data\_files/notebooks/Essentials\_notebooks.   

For examples on how to use PmagPy in a Jupyter notebook, see data\_files/notebooks/\_PmagPy\_nb.ipynb.

<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >The magnetic field is one component of the highly complex Earth system. It
interacts with the atmosphere, the biosphere, the deep mantle and even the inner
core. It also has the useful property of pointing roughly North (or South).
Records of the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field play a role in many aspects of Earth
Science; hence some knowledge of how it behaves is important to all Earth
scientists. The following introduces some of the reasons for studying the
geomagnetic field.

class="cmti-10x-x-109">Atmospheric interaction:  </span>Radioactive forms of carbon, beryllium and
     chlorine are produced in the atmosphere by cosmic ray bombardment.
     The decay of these isotopes is used for dating purposes in a wide variety
     of disciplines. There are large variations in ages predicted from tree
     ring, varve or ice layer counting or U/Th dating and those estimated
     by radiocarbon dating (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-1690051">14.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:c14 --></a>). Some of these variations are
     caused  by  changes  in  the  carbon  balance  between  the  atmosphere
     and the deep ocean (which is a reservoir of old carbon) and some
     could be caused by changes in magnetic field strength. Because the
     magnetic field shields the atmosphere to a large extent from cosmic
     rays, changes in the intensity of the magnetic field result in changes
     in production, hence are key to deriving accurate age information.
     To  date,  there  is  rather  poor  agreement  between  the  variations  in
     radiocarbon production predicted using changes in paleointensity of
     the geomagnetic field (compare Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-1690051">14.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:c14 --></a>b with c.) Either the field
     variations are not known, the relationship between those variations
     and radiocarbon production is not known or the actual variations in
     production are not known because of unconstrained reservoir effects
     (or any combination of these factors).

     There appears to be an annulus of faster velocities surrounding the
     Pacific ocean which may reflect the influence of cold subducted
     slabs. The geomagnetic field is generated by convection in the outer
     core. This convection could be a strong function of the thermal
     boundary conditions near the core mantle boundary. Temperature
     variations in the lowermost mantle therefore could conceivably
     have an effect on the geomagnetic field (e.g., Glatzmaier et al.,
     1999). Is there any evidence for this? Are there any changes in the

     expected from records of the geomagnetic field, as oppose to geological
     modification through initial recording bias, overprinting, or post-formation

microseconds (radio waves) to millions and perhaps billions of years. Direct
observations contribute to our knowledge of field behavior for the last few
centuries, but on longer times scales we need to use paleomagnetic and
archaeomagnetic techniques. We will first review what is known from historical
measurements of the geomagnetic field. Then we will turn to what we
can glean from accidental records made by archaeological and geological
materials.

<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >According to Needham (1962), changes in magnetic declination were discovered
in China around 720 CE when the astronomer Yi-Xing measured magnetic
declination (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-1690142">14.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:spoon --></a>b). The compass arrived in Europe some time in the
12<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">th</span></sup> century. Magnets and compasses were discussed in a letter (Epistola) by
Petrus Peregrinus written in 1269 (finally printed in 1558). Apparently the idea
of declination did not accompany the compass. The deviation of magnetic north
from true north was not rediscovered by Europeans until the early 1400s.
Europeans began to make systematic measurements of declination in the
early 1500s. Magnetic inclination was discovered in the mid-1500s in
Europe.
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >Gilbert (1600) noted variations in field strength with latitude based on the
sluggishness or rapidity with which a compass settled on the magnetic direction.
Magnetic intensity was first measured quantitatively in the late 1700s
by French scientist Robert de Paul, although all records were lost in a
ship wreck. The expedition sent to search for the lost ship made several
measurements, using the period of oscillation <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">T </span>of a vertical dip needle with
magnetic moment <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">m </span>and moment of inertia <span

These measurements supported Gilbert&#8217;s observation that the intensity of the
field increases away from the equator.
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >The internal origin of the magnetic field was discovered by Gilbert in 1546 who
made a systematic study of the magnets and the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field,
published in 1600. While aware of deviations of magnetic declination from true
                                                                     

                                                                     
north, Gilbert thought that the field was unchanging in time. In 1634 Gellibrand
compared declination measurements made in London over a period of some 50
years and concluded that the geomagnetic field changes. Thus Europeans
discovered secular variation of the magnetic field in 1634, nearly a millenium
after the Chinese.

<!--l. 172--><p class="nopar" >Strongly magnetized rocks (as opposed to the mineral lodestone) had been
noticed during the 1700s because of their effect on compass needles, but the fact
that certain rocks were magnetized in the direction of the Earth&#8217;s field was
discovered by Delesse in 1849 and Melloni in 1853. Folgheraiter extended
the study of fossil magnetizations to the magnetic properties of baked
archaeological materials in 1899. Naturally baked material (heated by lava flows)
was studied by David (1904) and Brunhes (1906). In the course of their
investigations, they discovered materials adjacent to normally magnetized rock
that were magnetized in a direction opposite to the Earth&#8217;s field. This
first application of the baked contact test led to speculation that the
Earth&#8217;s field had reversed its polarity in the past.  Mercanton (1926)
argued that the field had reversed polarity because reversely magnetized
rocks were found all over the world.  Matuyama (1929) further supported
the argument by demonstrating that all the reversely magnetized rocks
in Japan were older than the overlying normally magnetized rocks. It
was not until the combined use of paleomagnetism and K-Ar dating
allowed researchers in the U.S. and Australia (e.g.,  Cox et al., 1963;
McDougall and Tarling, 1963) to demonstrate the global synchrony of polarity
intervals that the scientific community embraced the notion of polarity
reversals.

field behavior to times without deliberate, systematic human measurements rely
on compilations of archaeomagnetic and paleomagnetic data. Constable et al.

archaeomagnetic and lake sediment sources evaluated at 100 year intervals
(PSVMOD1.0). We plot examples of several of the inclination records from East

models of Archaeomagnetic and Lake Sediment data for the past x thousand
years, version n. The first model of this series, CALS3K.1  (Korte and Constable,
2003) included no intensity information, while a more recent version, CALS7k.2,
relies on the data compilation of Korte et al. (2005) including directional and
intensity data from archaeological, sedimentary and volcanic sources spanning
the last seven millennia.
<!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >The CALS7K.2 model can be used for a wide range of studies (see  Korte and
Constable, 2008). For example, we can begin to answer questions such as the
control of the geomagnetic field on production of cosmogenic nuclides, or
millennial scale variability in the geomagnetic dipole. Geomagnetic field
vectors can be predicted for a given place at a given time. Predictions from
paleosecular variation &#8220;master curves&#8221; are frequently used to provide
constraints for archaeomagnetic dating (see, e.g., Lanos et al., 2005) and more
accurate field models of the CALSxK style will improve such constraints
considerably.

obtained from dry lake sediments exposed along the shores of Mono Lake in
California. The geomagnetic field oscillated around the direction expected from a
GAD field over an interval of some 9 meters. The amplitude of directional
variability is generally contained within about 30<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup> of the GAD direction. At
about 6.75 m, however, the field direction departed drastically from that,
achieving a nearly antipodal direction. This type of behavior is known as a
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">geomagnetic excursion</span>.
<!--l. 303--><p class="noindent" >The definition of a geomagnetic excursion is problematic. The traditional
definition identifies magnetic records in which the VGPs are more than 45<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup> away
from the average pole for that time and place as excursional. As we shall see in
Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-18200014.7">14.7<!--tex4ht:ref: sect:psvmods --></a>, the scatter in VGPs may depend on latitude with higher scatter at
higher latitudes. Basing the identification of an excursion on a given VGP
cut-off angle then means that more excursions will be identified at higher
latitudes.
<!--l. 306--><p class="noindent" >In a recent review of the phenomenon on excursions,  Laj and Channell (2007)
advocated that the term be used for features that represent departures from
&#8220;normal&#8221; secular variation, for which a full polarity reversal has not been
established. This usage is quite vague, relying on an undefined concept of what is
&#8220;normal&#8221;. They introduced the term <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">microchron </span>for brief polarity intervals.
These would exhibit fully reversed directions and would presumably be
globally oberved. Other definitions of the term &#8220;excursion&#8221; have been used
implicitly. For example, excursions are thought to be accompanied by a
decreases in paleointensity (DIPs) (a paleointensity low). For this reason,
                                                                     

                                                                     
some studies (e.g.,  Guyodo and Valet, 1999) have identified &#8220;excursions&#8221;
based on the occurrence of paleointensity lows (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-1740017">14.7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:sint800 --></a>). The
rationale for this lies in the fact that most &#8220;deviant&#8221; directions that

presupposes that the Mono Lake excursion is unique from other excursions
requiring a global assessment of excursions and their ages. The age of the Mono
Lake record has been hotly contested. Kent et al. (2002) argue that it
is approximately 38-41 ka, which is quite similar to the age of another
famous excursion, the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Laschamp excursion</span>, discovered in volcanics near
Laschamp, France (see Bonhommet and Zähringer, 1969 and references
therein; see also Plenier et al. 2007 for recent review of the Laschamp
data).
<!--l. 344--><p class="noindent" >Dating sedimentary sequences like the Mono Lake is difficult, but so is dating
very young lava flows like the Laschamp volcanics because of the low abundance
of radioactive potassium. Zimmerman et al. (2006) weighed in on the issue
using relative paleointensity data from the Wilson Creek section (shown
in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-1720016">14.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:lund --></a>) and concluded that the data agree best with relative
paleointensity data unequivocally associated with the Laschamp excursion.
Cassata et al. (2008) report new <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">36</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">39</span></sup>Ar ages ranging from 31.6<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">±</span>1.8 ka
to 39.1<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">±</span>4.1 ka for a set of volcanic rocks in New Zealand from which
&#8220;excursional&#8221; directions and low paleointensities had been obtained (Shibuya et
al., 1992; Cassidy, 2006; Mochizuki et al., 2006). Cassata et al. (2008)
claim that there are two excursions represented in these lavas and tie
them to the Mono Lake and Laschamp excursions, although there is no
volcanic stratigraphy to provide independent proof. The question as to
whether there are in fact two independent excursions is unresolved by these
data.
<!--l. 356--><p class="noindent" >Resolution of the Mono Lake-Laschamp mystery therefore lies in records with
stratigraphic age control. One such record is the paleointensity proxy record
of <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">36</span></sup>Cl and <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">10</span></sup>Be data in Greenland ice cores (GRIP and GISP cores).
The advantage of ice cores is that not only is the relative chronology
straight-forward, layer counting in the ice gives ages that are accurate to within
60 years. The isotopes <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">36</span></sup>Cl and <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">10</span></sup>Be are produced in the atmosphere
by cosmic ray bombardment which is modulated by the geomagnetic
field strength and the strength of the solar wind. Therefore changes in
production rate of these isotopes reflects to a large extent reflect changes in
intensity of the field. The isotopic data from the Greenland Summit
cores were summarized by Muscheler et al. (2005). The <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">10</span></sup>Be flux data do
                                                                     

                                                                     
not show two peaks, but a single peak centered at approximately 39 ka.
The <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">36</span></sup>Cl data, however are less straight-forward. The data differ in two
papers published in the same year on the same core by the same group
(Wagner et al., 2000a,b). One of these has two peaks, centered on <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>31
and <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>39 ka respectively, while the other has but a single peak at <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>39
ka.
<!--l. 362--><p class="noindent" >Another way of addressing the Mono Lake-Laschamp dilemma would be to look
at the sedimentary relative paleointensity database.  Tauxe and Yamazaki (2007)
compiled nearly all of the published relative paleointensity records. Data with
independent <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03B4;</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-8">18</span></sup>O age control spanning the last 100 kyrs are shown in
Figure&#x00A0;<a

class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>40 and <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~ </span>30 ka are marked with red and blue
bars. These have been interpreted as representing the &#8220;Mono Lake&#8221; and
&#8220;Laschamp&#8221; excursional paleointensity lows. While a few records appear to
have both, the evidence is not overwhelming for two globally recorded
features.
<!--l. 368--><p class="noindent" >Finally, we have the directional records from sedimentary sequences long enough
to record both excursions. Channell (2006) published a detailed record with
adequate independent age constraints from oxygen isotopes spanning the 30 to 42
kyr interval of interest (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-1770019">14.9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:919 --></a>). There are two distinct excursional
intervals in this record, one at <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>33 ka and the other at <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>40 ka. This core comes
from quite close to another core, SU92-18, whose relative paleointensity is shown
in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-1750058">14.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:sedpint --></a> and is one of the cores with two distinct paleointensity
lows.

<!--l. 385--><p class="noindent" >The conclusion from all these different perspectives is that while there may be
two excursions at about <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>30 and <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>40 ka respectively, it is still not clear whether
these are global features and which of these the sediments at Mono Lake itself
actually recorded. The conservative interpretation would be that there is a
globally observed feature with nearly fully reversed directions and low
paleointensity values at about <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~ </span>39 <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">± </span>2 ka observed in France, California and
New Zealand. Associated low paleomagnetic intensity values at about this
time are also observed at in the Greenland ice cores (by <sup><span

many deep sea sediment cores (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-1750058">14.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:sedpint --></a>). This feature should properly
be called the &#8220;Laschamp&#8221; and if we adopt the terminology of  Laj and
Channell (2007), it would be classified as a microchron. It is also clear
from the recent literature, that there is no consensus as to what the
term &#8220;excursion&#8221; means. Laj and Channell (2007) reserve the term for
what are essentially local phenomena that do not reach fully antipodal
directions. By this measure, the feature occasionally observed at about <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~ </span>30
ka would be an excursion. Because this was first well documented as
being a directional feature distinct from the Lashamp in the Irminger
Basin (Channell, 2006), perhaps it should be named the Irminger Basin
excursion.
<!--l. 393--><p class="noindent" >We have examined in detail only a few of the many directional and intensity
aberrations that have been called &#8220;excursions&#8221; over the years. Each has its own

the Mono Lake-Laschamp feature(s).

(Clement and Kent, 1984). The intensity of the magnetic field appears to drop to
approximately 10% of its average value and the directions migrate from
one pole to the other over a period of several thousand years. When
the polarity is the same as the present polarity it is said to be <span

When it is in the opposite state, it is said to be <span

the reversal process also appears to be a function of latitude  (Clement,

<!--l. 429--><p class="noindent" >The details of what happens during a polarity reversal are still rather unclear
because they occur so quickly, geologically speaking. Some high resolution
sedimentary records are like that shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-17700210">14.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:reversals --></a> whereby there is an
orderly progression from one polarity to the other. However, a polarity transition
captured by rapidly erupted lava flows records a more complex picture (see
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-17700210">14.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:reversals --></a>b). There are a few conclusions we can draw however: 1) they occur
quickly and 2) they are always associated with low geomagnetic intensities (see
Figure&#x00A0;<a

<!--l. 431--><p class="noindent" >A more controversial observation about directions in extrema was first pointed
out by Clement (1991); when mapped to VGP positions, they plot in preferred
longitudinal swaths (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-17700311">14.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:vgpspint --></a>b). These swaths are seen in many data
sets, but can be made to disappear when certain criteria are applied (e.g., Prévot
and Camps, 1993). The intriguing thing about the swaths is that they appear
to coincide with the shear velocity anomalies in the lowermost mantle
suggesting some control of the temperature structure near the core mantle
boundary on structure of the paleomagnetic field (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-17700311">14.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:vgpspint --></a>c).

example, Constable, 2003). Above the polarity history in Figure&#x00A0;<a

plot the reversal frequency estimated by Constable (2003). The reversal
frequency is relatively high in the interval 124-150 Ma, but appears to drop
gradually to zero at the beginning of the so-called Cretaceous Normal
Superchron (CNS), a period of some 38 Myr in which no (or very few) reversals
occurred. Since the end of the CNS at about 83 Ma, the frequency of
reversals has increased to the present average rate of about four per million
years.

using less than optimum criteria and that many more data of higher
overall quality may be required for a robust TAF model to be produced.
Data from the new TAF project are only just becoming available (e.g.,
Johnson et al. 2008). In the mean time, we show a plot of the TAF model of
Hatakayama and Kono (2002) in Figure&#x00A0;<a

perfectly GAD, the flux patches seen in the historical field are nearly
erased.
<!--l. 505--><p class="noindent" >One of the primary assumptions in many paleomagnetic studies is that the
magnetic field, when averaged over sufficient time, averages to that of a GAD
field. This means that if VGPs are averaged from units spanning enough time to
average out secular variation, the mean pole is coincident with the spin axis.
Such a pole is called a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">paleomagnetic pole</span>. As continents move, they
carry with them rock units that retain a record of the spin axis in the
continental reference frame, so these poles tend to form swaths called <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">apparent</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">polar wander paths </span>or APWPs. We will learn more about APWPs in
Chapter 16. It is worth mentioning here that it is not very well known
exactly how much time is required to average out secular variation; the
consensus is that it is more than 400 years but less than 5 million. Most text
books claim that 10<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">4</span></sup> &#8211;10<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">5</span></sup> years is sufficient. The minimum number of
                                                                     

                                                                     
sampling sites required for a &#8220;good&#8221; average is also poorly constrained.
Conventional wisdom suggests at least ten, while (Tauxe et al., 2003)
suggest that approximately 100 sites are required to fully sample secular
variation.

<!--l. 555--><p class="noindent" >The apparent trend in intensity might arise from inadequate temporal and
geographic sampling of the geomagnetic field (Lawrence et al., 2009). Or, it is
possible that the influence of the inner core manifests itself in lower average field
strengths at and above the cylinder tangent to it (the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">tangent cylinder</span>). The
geodynamo results from a complex combination of physical processes in the fluid
outer core (see, e.g., Merrill et al., 1996). The influence of the Coriolis force,
combined with the presence of the inner core results in a separation of the flow
regimes into two distinct regions bounded by a cylinder tangent to the inner core,
parallel to the spin axis. (e.g, Aurnou et al., 2003; see Figure &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x16-18000114">14.14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:tangent --></a>b). The
spin of the Earth tends to generate columnar convection in the region
outside the tangent cylinder, while inside, the convection tends to be more
3-dimensional (Busse, 1983). It is possible that the flow regime inside the
tangent cylinder results in a depressed field strength observed at high
latitude.

distortions in the recording process (some of which were discussed in

<!--l. 674--><p class="noindent" >Most early modeling efforts by the paleomagnetic community focussed on
explaining the variable scatter in directions and VGPs with latitude (see review

magnetic field is the <span

known as Model B  (Irving and Ward (1963). Dipole wobble (simulated by
random variations in the three dipole terms of the spherical harmonic expansion
of the geomagnetic field) produces Fisher distributed sets of virtual geomagnetic
poles (VGPs). These are centered around the spin axis. Because of the non-linear
transformation from VGPs to directions (see Chapters 2 and 12), the directions
associated with a circularly symmetric set of VGPs are not generally
circular.
<!--l. 686--><p class="noindent" >A different PSV model, Model A of  Irving and Ward (1963), starts from Fisher
distributed directional data modeled by adding directional perturbations drawn
from a uniform distribution to the expected dipole direction. The VGP
distribution resulting from such a process would be oval at the equator and
become more circular toward the poles.

there are other attributes of the field that can be predicted as well. For

Figure&#x00A0;<a

down with increasing latitude, while inclination goes up, there is a unique
elongation/inclination pair that is consistent with a given statistical field model.
The elongation/inclination trend calculated from the TK03.GAD model is shown
in Figure&#x00A0;<a

designed to do, but the model can be tested through time by calculating the
elongation/inclination pair for data sets of any age. The requirements are that
the data are referenced to paleo-horizontal, that the directions represent the
ancient geomagnetic field (they are not biased by overprinting, inclination error,
etc.), and that there be a sufficient number to represent the statistical variability
of the ancient geomagnetic field. There are not many data sets that satisfy these
requirements. Tauxe et al. (2008) compiled data sets from ancient large igneous
provinces that did: the Deccan Traps in India (Vandamme et al., 1991,
Vandamme and Courtillot, 1992), the Faroe Island basalts (Riisager et al.,
2002), and Kerguelen (Plenier et al., 2002). The elongation/inclination
pairs from these data sets are plotted on Figure&#x00A0;<a

be used as a guide to the geomagnetic field behavior for at least the
Tertiary.

<!--l. 780--><p class="noindent" >a) Find all the VDM/VADM estimates for the last 10 Myr. Select the data
that were done with a Thellier double heating type experiment, with
pTRM checks (T+) and those that were done with the Shaw method
(S). Plot the VDM/VADMs from both sets versus age. Are there any
differences?
<!--l. 783--><p class="noindent" >b) Now find all the T+ data that have polarity information for the last 10 Myr.
Separate the data into N, R, and T groups. Plot these versus age (with different
symbols). Are there any differences?

<!--l. 795--><p class="noindent" >b) Read in the site mean data from the <span

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">ipmag.plot</span><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">_di </span>functions
from within your Jupyter notebook. Be sure to get rid of all the blank

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">ipmag.plot</span><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">_vgp </span>To do that, you will need to have
Basemap installed. Follow the instructions in the help message to make a simple
map. As this is a dual polarity data set, first make an nested [lon,lat] array and
use <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">pmag.flip </span>to separate it into normal and verse antipodes. Be sure to drop all
the records with no VGP data in them (using Pandas dropna function)
first.

VGPs. What is <span

class="cmmi-8">p</span></sub> of the entire data set? [Use the antipodes of the reverse
data.]

class="cmmi-10x-x-109">S</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">p</span></sub> as a function of latitude cutoff, i.e.,
make an option to exclude VGP latitudes with latitudes more than a

cut-off?
<!--l. 803--><p class="noindent" >e) A file called <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">hawaii.txt </span>is stored in the Chapter_14/Problem_3 directory.
This is a compilation of all the data from Hawaii used in a recent analysis
of the time averaged field project by Cromwell et al. (2018). Repeat
problems 2b-d on the Hawaiian data set. Is there a latitude dependence of
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">S</span><sub><span

<!--l. 811--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Problem 4</span>
<!--l. 813--><p class="noindent" >a) Use the program <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">ipmag.tk03 </span>to generate a nested list of 100 vectors for a
latitude of 20<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup> (the approximate latitude of Hawaii). Plot them using the
functions <span

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">_net, ipmag.plot</span><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">_di</span>. Hint, it would be easiest to
turn the output of <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">ipmag.tk03 </span>into an array and take the transpose.
Then the first element is an array of declinations and the second is the
inclinations.
<!--l. 815--><p class="noindent" >b) Find the present IGRF and GAD directions at 20<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup> and -156<sup><span

the expected GAD direction using the function <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">pmag.dodirot</span><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">_V</span>. Hint: try the
nice <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">NumPy </span>function <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">column</span><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">_stack </span>to put your directions into the right
format. Plot these rotated directions using the <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">ipmag </span>functions. Now rotate the
directions extracted from <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">hawaii.txt </span>in Problem 2e plot them in equal area
projection. How do the directions predicted by the PSV field model compare with
the data set from Hawaii?
<!--l. 818--><p class="noindent" >c) Use the function <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">pmag.doprinc </span>to calculate the eigenparameters of the
orientation matrix of the Hawaiian directions (see Chapter 9 and the Appendix
on Orientation Tensors here:

<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >Paleomagnetists have depended since the 1950&#8217;s on the special statistical
framework developed by Fisher (1953) for the analysis of unit vector data. The
power and flexibility of a variety of tools based on Fisher statistics enables
quantification of parameters such as the degree of rotation of a crustal block,
or whether the geomagnetic field really averages to a geocentric axial
dipole independent of polarity. These tools, however, require that the
paleomagnetic data belong to a particular parametric distribution &#8211; the Fisher
distribution.

<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >In many important situations, the Fisher distribution fails to represent
paleomagnetic data adequately. To begin with, the geomagnetic field itself can
produce directions that are far from Fisher distributed. Most statistical
paleosecular variation models generate spherically symmetric distributions of the
VGPs (see, e.g., Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1440011">12.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:vgp-di --></a>a). When converted to equivalent directions, they are
more elongate as the observation site approaches the equator (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1440011">12.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:vgp-di --></a>b).
Because VGPs that are farther from the pole are associated with weaker field
strengths in collections of paleomagnetic data and in many models of the field,
the Fisher assumption of unit vector length over-emphasizes the importance of
the &#8220;outliers&#8221; and leads to mean inclinations that are shallower than the
true mean (see e.g., Creer, 1983). Another example of the inadequacy
of the Fisher distribution is the fact that the magnetic field exists in
two stable polarity states. Because the Fisher distribution allows only
uni-modal data, bi-polar data must be separated into separate modes or one
mode must be &#8220;flipped&#8221; to the antipode prior to calculating a mean.
Remanence vectors composed of several components tend to form streaked
distributions. Structural complications (e.g., folding) can lead to streaked
distributions of directional data. And, inclination error arising from flattening of
directions tends to form &#8220;squashed&#8221; directional distributions that are
wider in the horizontal plane than in the vertical. These are all commonly
observed pathologies in directional data sets that lead to non-Fisherian data
distributions.
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >Thus, non-Fisherian data are a fact of paleomagnetic life. The Fisher-based tests
can frequently be inappropriate and could result in flawed interpretations. In
Chapter 11 we learned the basics of Fisher statistics and how to test data sets
against a Fisher distribution. In this chapter, we will discuss what to do when
Fisher statistics fail. We will begin with parametric approaches that
treat certain types of non-fisherian data. We then turn to the use of
non-parametric methods such as the bootstrap and jackknife in paleomagnetic
applications.

<!--l. 63--><p class="nopar" >Many paleomagnetic data sets have a more elliptical distribution than the
symmetrical distribution required for a Fisherian data set. To treat such data, it
is probably inappropriate to use a Fisher cone of confidence and a distribution
that allows data with elliptical directional dispersion would be better. The
elliptical analogue of the Fisher distribution is the Kent distribution (Kent, 1982)
and is given by:

the Fisher distribution (see Chapter 11). The difference is that when
transformed to the mean direction, Kent declinations are not uniformly
distributed around the mean. If we calculate eigenparameters for the

while the Fisher distribution cannot. However, many paleomagnetic data sets are
also bi-modal (reversals!) and the Kent and Fisher distributions can only deal
with data sets with a single polarity. It was precisely for the purpose of treating
bimodal, elliptical data that the Bingham distribution was developed (Bingham,
1974). The Bingham distribution is given by:

semi-axes of the 95% confidence ellipse are proportional to the intermediate
and minimum eigenvalues. The Bingham principal direction therefore is
not necessarily the same as the Fisher or Kent mean. If we take each
vector end-point to be a mass, the Bingham principal direction is the
axis about which the moment of inertia of the masses would be least.
The Fisher mean is somewhat different, in that it is the vector sum of
unit vectors. The Bingham mean (principal direction) is less affected by
outliers than the Fisher mean, lying closer to the center of mass of data
points.

orientation matrix uses the entire data set (normal and reverse) the two modes
are assumed to be antipodal and to share the same distribution parameters.
The question of whether normal and reverse data sets are antipodal and
have the same dispersion is in fact one we may wish to ask! One could
separate the two modes prior to calculation of the Bingham ellipse, but
then the rationale for using the Bingham distribution is lost. Also, many
published descriptions of the Bingham calculation (e.g., Onstott et al. 1980,
Borradaile, 2003) have errors in them. The source code for calculating
Bingham statistics in widely used paleomagnetic data reduction programs is
generally not available, and it is unknown whether these programs contain
bugs.

<!--l. 153--><p class="nopar" >As we have mentioned, real data may be pathological in several respects
including bi-modal and elliptically distributed data. None of the methods we
have described so far have the test for common mean so critical to paleomagnetic
studies nor can they provide confidence ellipses for an off-center mean direction
as is likely to occur in records of the geomagnetic field (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1440011">12.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:vgp-di --></a>b).
Finally, data may be overprinted or contain the record of a paleomagnetic
transition, resulting in &#8220;streaked&#8221; or non-antipodal distributions, conditions that
make the conventional methods inappropriate. In this section we will discuss
alternative methods for estimating confidence bounds which are sufficiently
flexible to accomodate all of these short comings, provided the data set is large
enough.
<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >In Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1490014">12.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hypeq --></a>a we show a not unusual &#8220;not great&#8221; paleomagnetic data set. The
data are elliptical, bi-modal and one has the suspicion that the normal and
reverse modes may be neither antipodal nor share the same concentration or
ovalness parameters. Clearly some non-parametric approach would be desirable.
The approach for characterizing uncertainties for vectors we will take here is
based on a technique known as the statistical <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">bootstrap</span>. As we shall see, the
bootstrap has the flexibility to allow us to treat awkward data sets like that
shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1490014">12.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hypeq --></a>a.
<!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >The principles of the bootstrap are given in Appendix&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ap1.html#x19-224000A.3.7">A.3.7<!--tex4ht:ref: app:bootstrap --></a>. In essence, the
parameter of interest (say, the mean vector) is calculated from many resampled
data sets, whose data points are selected at random from the original data. The
bootstrapped estimates &#8220;map out&#8221; the likely distribution of the parameter,
allowing estimation of confidence regions. Before we extend the bootstrap from
the scalar treatment in Appendix&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ap1.html#x19-224000A.3.7">A.3.7<!--tex4ht:ref: app:bootstrap --></a> to vectors, it is important to point out
that with the bootstrap, it is assumed that the underlying distribution is
represented by the data, demanding that the data sets be rather large. Moreover,
the bootstrap estimates are only asymptotically valid, meaning that a
large number of bootstrap calculations are required for the confidence
intervals to be valid. It&#8217;s a good thing we have fast computers with huge
hard-drives.
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >There are a variety of ways we can use the bootstrap to estimate confidence
                                                                     

                                                                     
regions for paleomagnetic data. We will start with the most &#8220;Fisher&#8221; like
approach of taking unit vectors of a single polarity. Then we will accommodate
dual polarity data sets and develop analogous tests to those so useful for Fisher
distributions.
<!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" >To do a simple bootstrap on a data set with only one polarity (say the normal
data in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1490014">12.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hypeq --></a>a, we first randomly draw <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">N </span>data points from the data shown
in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1490014">12.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hypeq --></a>a. Each set of <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">N </span>data points is a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">pseudo-sample</span>. Note that some
data points will be drawn more than once while others will not be drawn at all
in a particular pseudo-sample. We then calculate a Fisher mean of the
pseudo-sample (one little circle in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1490014">12.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hypeq --></a>b. This resampling procedure
can be repeated many times. We show 500 such bootstrapped means in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1490014">12.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hypeq --></a>b.
<!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" >Now we can estimate the region of 95% confidence for the bootstrapped means. A
non-parametric approach would be to draw a contour enclosing 95% of the
bootstrapped means. In many applications, paleomagnetists desire a more
compact way of expressing confidence regions (for example, to list them in a
table) and this necessitates some parametric assumptions about the distribution
of the means. For this limited purpose, approximate 95% confidence regions can
be estimated by noting the elliptical distribution of the bootstrapped means and
by assuming that they are Kent (1982) distributed. Such bootstrap confidence
ellipses are shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1490014">12.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hypeq --></a>c.
<!--l. 192--><p class="noindent" >When paleomagnetic data are bimodal, as in Figure&#x00A0;<a

class="cmr-8">1</span></sub>) as in Bingham statistics of each bootstrapped pseudo-sample or we
can separate the data into two modes and calculate Fisher means for each mode
separately (as in Figure&#x00A0;<a

<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >To separate the data into normal and reverse subsets, we first calculate the
principle direction of the whole dataset. This will be more or less parallel to the
Fisher mean of one of the modes. Any direction more than 90<sup><span

could be placed in the second mode. After separation, Fisher means of the
bootstrapped pseudo-samples can be calculated for each mode separately.
Alternatively, if a more robust estimate of the &#8220;average&#8221; direction is desired, one
could calculate the principal eigenvector <span

distribution is assumed for the data. We did assume, however, that all the
uncertainty inherent in the data is reflected in the data distribution. If the data
set is smaller than about <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">N </span>= 20, this leads to uncertainty ellipses that are too
small (Tauxe et al., 1991). Many paleomagnetic data sets are smaller than this,
yet they are demonstrably non-Fisherian. Luckily, if we are able to assume some
parametric form for data from e.g., a given site, we can use a superior
technique which is known as the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">parametric bootstrap</span>. As applied here, we
assume that each site with <span

testable assumption). Then, after random selection of a particular site for
inclusion in the pseudo-sample, we draw <span

<!--l. 312--><p class="nopar" >A final test is useful in paleomagnetism: the fold test (Chapter 9). If a rock
has moved from its original position, was it magnetized in the original,
in the present or in some other position? Moreover, is simple rotation
about strike an appropriate method to restore the beds to their original
positions? In the classic fold test envisioned by Graham (1949), (see
Chapters 9 and 11), the directions of magnetization of a deformed rock
unit are assumed to be most closely parallel in the orientation in which
the magnetization was acquired. Therefore, if a rock has retained an
original magnetization through a subsequent folding or tilting event, the
magnetic directions may cluster most tightly after they have been rotated
back to their original positions. This of course is not necessarily true for
elongate data such as those shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1460022">12.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:confidence --></a>a for which we can imagine
pathological cases that result in a more tightly clustered set of directions in
a coordinate system other than the one the data were magnetized in.
Nonetheless, the clustering assumption is probably reasonable in most
scenarios.
<!--l. 335--><p class="noindent" >The fold test appears at first glance to be simple, but it is not. The primary
problem is that paleomagnetic vectors are never perfectly parallel. The
scattered nature of the data means that a statistical test is necessary to
determine whether clustering is &#8220;significantly&#8221; better in one orientation or
another.
<!--l. 344--><p class="noindent" >In Chapter 11 we suggested that variances could be compared using an F-test, so
it was long the practice in paleomagnetism to compare estimated precisions
before and after tilt adjustment (McElhinny, 1964). The ratio of the two
estimates of <span

Ratios higher than the <span

significant increase in concentration after adjusting for tilt, thus representing a

that gave rise to the VGPs shown in Figure 12.1a. They have been rotated
about strike on two simulated limbs of the fold, one to the northeast and one
to the southwest, resulting in a streaked (girdle) distribution. The original

<!--l. 375--><p class="noindent" >Although its simplicity is a great strength, there are several problems with the
classical fold test. First, the geomagnetic field has two preferred states and is not
perfectly dipolar. Directions observed in paleomagnetic samples are therefore not
only scattered but are often of two polarities. Second, the magnetic directions
may be most tightly clustered somewhere other than in &#8220;geographic&#8221; or 100% tilt
adjusted coordinates (McCabe et al., 1983). Finally, structural &#8220;corrections&#8221; are
not perfectly known. Not only are the bedding orientations themselves often
difficult to measure accurately, but detection of complications such as
plunging folds, and multiple phases of tilting requires extensive field work. It
is nearly impossible to assess rotation about the vertical axis on the
basis of field relations alone, as it results in no visible effect on the dip of
the beds themselves. Because of this uncertainty, we might reasonably
ask whether if the data are actually most tightly clustered at, say 90%
tilt adjusted (as opposed to 100%), does this constitute a &#8220;failed&#8221; fold
test.
<!--l. 393--><p class="noindent" >We consider first the problem of dual polarity. We plot a hypothetical data set in
geographic coordinates in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1540018">12.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:foldtest --></a>a and in tilt adjusted coordinates in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1540018">12.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:foldtest --></a>b. The polarity is ambiguous but the classic fold test requires
calculation of <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BA; </span>which can only be done with data of a single polarity. Obviously,
fold tests that rely on <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BA; </span>will not be straight forward with data such as
these.
<!--l. 399--><p class="noindent" >An alternative approach is based on the orientation matrix (Tauxe and Watson,
1994). [Please read Appendix&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ap1.html#x19-219000A.3.5">A.3.5<!--tex4ht:ref: app:eigen --></a> if you have not yet done so.] In the
orientation matrix, polarity does not play a role and the &#8220;tightness&#8221; of grouping
is reflected in the relative magnitudes of the eigenvalues (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4;</span>). As the data become
more tightly grouped, the variance along the principal axis grows and those along
the other axes shrink. Thus, examination of the behavior of <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4;</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub> during unfolding
would reveal the point at which the tightest grouping is achieved, without
knowledge of polarity.
<!--l. 413--><p class="noindent" >Suppose we find that the degree of unfolding required to produce the maximum
in <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4;</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub> is 98%. Is this a positive fold test suggesting a pre-folding remanence or is
the difference between 98% and 100% significant? For this we call on the by now
familiar bootstrap. Numerous pseudo-samples can be drawn. We can then
calculate the eigenparameters of the orientation matrix for a range of percent
unfolding. Some examples of the behavior of <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4;</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub> during tilt adjustment of
representative pseudo-samples drawn from the data in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1540018">12.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:foldtest --></a>a are shown in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1540018">12.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:foldtest --></a>c. The green line in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1540018">12.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:foldtest --></a>c is a cumulative distribution plot of
                                                                     

                                                                     
maxima in <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4;</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub> from 500 pseudo-samples. These are sorted and the 95%
confidence interval for the degree of unfolding required to produce the
tightest grouping (the highest <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4;</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub>) is thus constrained to lie between 97 and
102%.
<!--l. 431--><p class="noindent" >The data from Figure &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1540018">12.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:foldtest --></a>a are shown after 100% tilt adjustment in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x14-1540018">12.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:foldtest --></a>b. The tilt adjusted data are not only better grouped, but now the
polarities of most samples can be readily determined. An advantage of the
eigenparameter approach is the fact that the data do not need prior editing to
split them into normal and reversed polarity groups, which is a particularly
onerous task for the data considered here.
<!--l. 441--><p class="noindent" >For small data sets, we could employ a parametric bootstrap, whereby
pseudo-samples are generated by first randomly selecting a site for inclusion, then
by drawing a substitute direction from a Fisher distribution having the same <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">D</span>,
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">I</span>, <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">N</span>, and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BA;</span>.
<!--l. 446--><p class="noindent" >We can incorporate uncertainties in bedding into the bootstrap. If we assume
that the poles to the bedding planes are Fisher distributed, and we can
assign some estimated <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BA; </span>value to the distribution of poles based on repeat
measurements (say, <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BA; </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x2243; </span>30), we can draw poles to the beds from Fisher
distributions using the assigned mean direction and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BA;</span>. We would then use these
simulated poles in the structural corrections on the pseudo-samples. This
procedure would propagate the uncertainties in structural corrections through
the fold test, resulting in more realistic confidence bounds on the peak in
concentration during unfolding.
<!--l. 448--><p class="noindent" >Finally, it is important to remember that peaks in concentration between 0 and
100% unfolding can result from a variety of causes. Traditionally, intermediate
peaks have been interpreted as resulting from remagnetization of the rock units
during folding (see, e.g., McCabe et al., 1983). Such behavior could also result
from failure to account for plunging folds, or vertical axis rotation between blocks
(see Tauxe and Watson, 1994), so some caution should be exercised when
interpreting fold test results.

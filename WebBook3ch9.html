<!--l. 9--><p class="nopar" >Rocks become magnetized in a variety of ways (see Chapter 7). Both igneous and
sedimentary rocks can be affected by chemical change, thereby acquiring a
secondary magnetization. Many magnetic materials are affected by viscous
remanent magnetization. The various components of magnetization sum together
to constitute the NRM which is the &#8220;raw&#8221; remanence of the sample after
extraction. The goal of paleomagnetic laboratory work is to isolate the various
components of remanence and to ascribe origin, age and reliability to these
components. But before the laboratory work can begin, samples must be
collected. Sampling strategy is crucial to a successful study. In this chapter, we
will briefly describe techniques for sampling, methods of orientation and overall
philosophy. We will then turn to an overview of some of the more useful field and
laboratory techniques that wind up with an estimate of a paleomagnetic
direction.
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.1   </span> <a 
href="WebBook3.html#QQ2-11-223" id="x11-1040009.1">Paleomagnetic sampling</a></h3>
<!--l. 28--><p class="nopar" >There are several goals in paleomagnetic sampling: one is to average out the
errors involved in the sampling process itself, and to assess the reliability of the
recording medium (recording noise). In addition, we often wish to sample the
range of secular variation of the geomagnetic field in order to average it
out or characterize its statistical properties. The objectives of averaging
recording and sampling &#8220;noise&#8221; are achieved by taking a number <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">N </span>of
individually oriented <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">samples </span>from a single unit (called a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">site</span>). Samples
should be taken such that they represent a single time horizon, that is,
they are from a single cooling unit or the same sedimentary horizon.
The most careful sample orientation procedure has an uncertainty of
several degrees. Precision is gained proportional to <img 
src="WebBook3243x.png" alt="&#x221A; --
  N"  class="sqrt" >, so to improve the
precision, multiple individually oriented samples are required. The number of
samples taken should be tailored to the particular project at hand. If
one wishes to know polarity, perhaps three samples would be sufficient
(these would be taken primarily to assess recording noise). If, on the
other hand, one wished to make inferences about secular variation of the
                                                                     

                                                                     
geomagnetic field, more samples would be necessary to suppress sampling
noise.
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >Some applications in paleomagnetism require that the secular variation of the
geomagnetic field (the paleomagnetic &#8220;noise&#8221;) be averaged in order to determine
the time-averaged field direction. The geomagnetic field varies with time
constants ranging from milliseconds to millions of years. It is a reasonable first
order approximation to assume that, when averaged over, say, 10<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">4</span></sup> or 10<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">5</span></sup> years,
the geomagnetic field is similar to that of a geocentric axial dipole (equivalent to
the field that would be produced by a bar magnet at the center of the Earth,
aligned with the spin axis; see Chapter 2). Thus, when a time-averaged field
direction is required, enough sites must be sampled to span sufficient time to
achieve this goal. A general rule of thumb would be to aim for about
ten sites (each with nine to ten samples), spanning 100,000 years. If the
distribution of geomagnetic field vectors is desired, then more like 100 sites are
necessary.

     drilling apparatus with a water-cooled diamond bit (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-1040011">9.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drill --></a>a). The
     diameter of cores is usually <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>2.5 cm. After drilling into the outcrop to
     a depth of 6 to 12 cm, an orientation device is slipped over the sample
     while it is still attached to the outcrop at its base (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-1040011">9.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drill --></a>b and
     Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-1050084">9.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:orientation --></a>). Orientation devices have an inclinometer for determining
     dip  (angle  from  the  horizontal  down  or  up)  or  the  hade  (angle
     from the vertical down direction) of the core axis. They also have
     a  magnetic  and/or  sun  compass  for  determining  azimuth  of  core
     axis.  The  accuracy  of  orientation  by  such  methods  is  about  <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">±</span>3<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup>.
     A  fiducial  mark  is  scratched  on  to  the  core  with  a  brass  wire
     (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-1040011">9.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drill --></a>b), or if the core has broken free, a mark is made on the
     outcrop and transferred to the core (with a degradation of accuracy
     in orientation). After orientation, the core is broken from the outcrop
     (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-1040011">9.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drill --></a>c), marked for orientation and identification (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-1040011">9.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drill --></a>d),
     and returned to the laboratory. Advantages of the coring technique
     are the ability to obtain samples from a wide variety of natural or
     artificial exposures and accurate orientation. Disadvantages include
     the necessity of transporting heavy fluids (water and gasoline) to the
     sampling site, dependence on performance of the drilling apparatus
     (often in remote locations), and herniated disks, damaged shoulders
     and hearing loss suffered by inveterate drillers.

     oriented  block  samples.  Some  samples  can  be  shaved  with  a  hand
     rasp to create a flat surface which can be oriented (e.g., Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-1040022">9.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hand --></a>).
     Joint blocks are often oriented (generally by determining the strike and
     dip of a surface) and then removed from the outcrop. For unlithified
     sediments, samples may be carved from the outcrop (see also Schnepp
     et al., 2008). Advantages of block sampling are freedom from reliance
     on  coring  apparatus  and  the  ability  to  collect  lithologies  that  are
     unsuitable for coring. There are, however, conspicuous disadvantages:
     limited accuracy of orientation, the need to collect joint blocks (likely
     more weathered than massive portions of outcrops), and the need to
     transport large numbers of cumbersome block samples out of the field
     and later subsample or sand these to obtain specimens.

<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >The diversity of paleomagnetic investigations and applications makes it hard to
generalize about sample collection, but there are some time-honored
recommendations. One obvious recommendation is to collect fresh, unweathered
samples. Surface weathering oxidizes magnetite to hematite or iron-oxyhydroxides,
with attendant deterioration of NRM carried by magnetite and possible
formation of modern CRM. Artificial outcrops (such as road cuts) thus are
preferred locations, and rapidly incising gorges provide the best natural
exposures.
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >Lightning strikes can produce significant secondary IRM, which can mask the
primary remanence. Although partial demagnetization in the laboratory can
often erase lightning-induced IRM, the best policy is to avoid lightning-prone
areas. When possible, avoid topographic highs, especially in tropical regions. If
samples must be collected in lightning-prone areas, effects of lightning can be
minimized by surveying the outcrop prior to sample collection to find areas that
have probably been struck by lightning. This is done by &#8220;mapping&#8221; the areas
where significant (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x003E; </span>5<sup><span

compass is passed over an outcrop at a distance of <span

rock face while the compass is held in fixed azimuth, the strong and
inhomogeneous IRM produced by a lightning strike will cause detectable
deflections of the compass. These regions then can be avoided during sample
collection.

The hade (angle from vertical down) or plunge (angle down [positive] or
up [negative] from horizontal) of the sample can also be gotten using
an inclinometer (either with a Pomeroy orientation device as shown in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-1040011">9.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drill --></a> or with some other inclinometer, such as that on a Brunton
Compass.)
<!--l. 201--><p class="noindent" >Sometimes large local magnetic anomalies, for example from a strongly
magnetized rock unit, can lead to a bias in the magnetic direction that is not
compensated for by the IGRF magnetic declination. In such cases, some other
means of sample orientation is required. One relatively straightforward way is to
use a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">sun compass</span>. Calculation of a direction using a sun compass is more
involved than for magnetic compass, however. A dial with a vertical needle (a
<span

href="#x11-1050095">9.5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:suncomp --></a>. The angle (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03B1;</span>)
that the sun&#8217;s shadow makes with the drilling direction is noted as well as the
exact time of sampling and the location of the sampling site. With this
information and the aid of the Astronomical Almanac or a simple algorithm (see
                                                                     

                                                                     
Appendix&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ap1.html#x19-225000A.3.8">A.3.8<!--tex4ht:ref: app:sundec --></a>), it is possible to calculate the desired direction to reasonable
accuracy (the biggest cause of uncertainty is actually reading the shadow
angle!).
<!--l. 215--><p class="noindent" >Another way to avoid the deflection of the compass needle by strong local
magnetic anomalies is to check the direction by sighting to known landmarks or
by moving a second magnetic compass well away from the outcrop and
<span

gnomon and sighting tip of the original compass as guides (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-1060016">9.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:backbite --></a>). The
original magnetic compass direction (near the outcrop) can be compared to the
backsighted direction in order to detect and remove any deflection. Of course the
compass reading made with the orientation device (near outcrop) is more
precise (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~ </span>3<sup><span

<!--l. 235--><p class="noindent" >A new technique, developed by C. Constable and F. Vernon at Scripps

Positioning System (GPS) technology (see Figure&#x00A0;<a

azimuth of a baseline. Two GPS receivers are attached to either end of
a one meter long non-magnetic rigid base. The location and azimuth
of the baseline can be computed from the signals detected by the two
receivers. The orientation of the baseline is transferred to the paleomagnetic
samples using a laser mounted on the base which is focused on a prism
attached to the orientation device used to orient the paleomagnetic samples.
The orientations derived by the differential GPS are nearly identical to
those obtained by a sun compass, although it takes at least an additional
half hour and is rather awkward to transport. Nonetheless, achieving
sun-compass accuracy in orientations when the sun is unlikely to be readily
available is a major breakthrough for high latitude paleomagnetic field
procedures.

A rule of thumb about terminology is that a sample is something you take
and a specimen is something you measure. The two may be the same
object, or there may be multiple specimens per sample. A site is a single
horizon or instant in time and may comprise multiple samples or may be
only a single sample, depending on the application. Multiple specimens
from a single site are expected to have recorded the same geomagnetic

<span

be determined relative to the three axes defined by the sample coordinate
system. The magnetization along a given axis is measured by detecting the
voltages induced by the spinning magnetic moment within a set of pick-up
coils.
<!--l. 283--><p class="noindent" >Another popular way to measure the magnetization of a specimen is to use a
<span

<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">superconducting quantum interference devices </span>(SQUIDs). In a SQUID,
the flux of an inserted specimen is opposed by a current in a loop of
superconducting wire. The superconducting loop is constructed with a
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">weak link </span>which stops superconducting at some very low current density,
corresponding to some very small quantum of flux. Thus the flux within the loop
                                                                     

                                                                     
can change by discrete quanta. Each incremental change is counted and
the total flux is proportional to the magnetization along the axis of the
SQUID. Cryogenic magnetometers are much faster and more sensitive
than spinner magnetometers, but they cost much more to buy and to
operate.

<!--l. 373--><p class="nopar" >Anyone who has dealt with magnets (including magnetic tape, credit cards, and
magnets) knows that they are delicate and likely to demagnetize or change their
magnetic properties if abused by heat, large magnetic fields or stress. Cassette
tapes left on the dashboard of the car in the hot sun never sound the same.
Credit cards that have been through the dryer may lead to acute embarrassment
at the check-out counter. Magnets that have been dropped, do not work as well
afterwards. It is not difficult to imagine that rocks that have been left
in the hot sun or buried deep in the crust (not to mention altered by
diagenesis or bashed with hammers, drills, pick axes, etc.), may not have their
original magnetic vectors completely intact. Because rocks often contain
millions of tiny magnets, it is possible that some (or all) of these have
become realigned, or that they grew since the rock formed. In many cases,
there are still grains that carry the original remanent vector, but there
are often populations of grains that have acquired new components of
magnetization. The good news is that viscous magnetizations are carried by
grains with lower magnetic anisotropy energies (they are &#8220;softer&#8221;, magnetically
speaking), so we expect their contribution to be more easily randomized
than the more stable (&#8220;harder&#8221;) grains carrying the ancient remanent
magnetization.
<!--l. 399--><p class="noindent" >There are several laboratory techniques that are available for separating various
components of magnetization. Paleomagnetists rely on the relationship of
relaxation time, coercivity, and temperature in order to remove (<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">demagnetize</span>)
low stability remanence components. The fundamental principle that underlies
demagnetization techniques is that the lower the relaxation time <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4;</span>, the more
likely the grain will carry a secondary magnetization. The basis for <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">alternating</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">field </span>(AF) demagnetization is that components with short relaxation times also
have low coercivities. The basis for <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">thermal </span>demagnetization is that these grains
also have low blocking temperatures.
<!--l. 416--><p class="noindent" >In AF demagnetization, an oscillating field is applied to a paleomagnetic
specimen in a null magnetic field environment (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ch7.html#x9-7600122">7.22<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:arm --></a> in Chapter 7). All the
grain moments with coercivities below the peak AF will track the field. These
entrained moments will become stuck as the peak field gradually decays below
the coercivities of individual grains. Assuming that there is a range of coercivities
in the specimen, the low stability grains will be stuck half along one direction of
                                                                     

                                                                     
the AF and half along the other direction; the net contribution to the remanence
will be zero. In practice, we demagnetize specimens sequentially along three
orthogonal axes, or while &#8220;tumbling&#8221; the specimen around three axes during
demagnetization.
<!--l. 430--><p class="noindent" >Thermal demagnetization exploits the relationship of relaxation time and
temperature. There will be a temperature below the Curie temperature at
which the relaxation time is a few hundred seconds. When heated to this
temperature, grains with relaxation times this short will be in equilibrium
with the field. This is the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">unblocking temperature</span>. If the external field is
zero, then there will be no net magnetization. Lowering the temperature
back to room temperature will result in the relaxation times growing
exponentially until these moments are once again fixed. In this way, the
contribution of lower stability grains to the NRM can be randomized.
Alternatively, if there is a DC field applied during cooling, the grains whose
unblocking temperatures have been exceeded will be realigned in the new field
direction; they will have acquired a partial thermal remanent magnetization
(pTRM).
<!--l. 433--><p class="noindent" >We sketch the principles of progressive (step-wise) demagnetization in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900210">9.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:comps --></a>. Initially, the NRM is the sum of two components carried by
populations with different coercivities. The distributions of coercivities are shown
in the histograms to the left in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900210">9.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:comps --></a>. Two components of magnetization
are shown as heavy lines in the plots to the right. In these examples,
the two components are orthogonal. The sum of the two components at
the start (the NRM or demagnetization step &#8216;0&#8217;) is shown as a + on
the vector plots to the right. After the first AF demagnetization step,
the contribution of the lowest coercivity grains has been erased and the
remanence vector moves to the position of the first dot away from the +.
Increasing the AF in successive treatment steps (some are numbered in the
diagram) gradually eats away at the remanence vectors (shown as dashed
arrows and dots in the plots to the right) which eventually approach the
origin.
<!--l. 453--><p class="noindent" >There are four different sets of coercivity spectra shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900210">9.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:comps --></a>, each with
a distinctive behavior during demagnetization. If the two coercivity fractions are
completely distinct, the two components are clearly defined (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900210">9.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:comps --></a>a) by the
progressive demagnetization. If there is some overlap in the coercivity
distribution of the components the resulting demagnetization diagram is curved
(Figure &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900210">9.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:comps --></a>b). If the two components completely overlap, both components are
                                                                     

                                                                     
removed simultaneously and an apparently single component demagnetization
diagram may result (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900210">9.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:comps --></a>c). It is also possible for one coercivity
spectrum to include another as shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900210">9.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:comps --></a>d. Such cases result in
&#8220;S&#8221; shaped demagnetization curves. Because complete overlap actually
happens in &#8220;real&#8221; rocks, it is desirable to perform both AF and thermal
demagnetization. If the two components overlap completely in coercivity, they
might not have overlapping blocking temperature distributions and vice
versa. It is unlikely that specimens from the same lithology will all have
identical overlapping distributions, so multiple specimens can provide
clues to the possibility of completely overlapped directions in a given
specimen.

<!--l. 480--><p class="nopar" >Now we will consider briefly the issue of what to do with the demagnetization
data in terms of display and estimating a best-fit direction for various
components.
<!--l. 482--><p class="noindent" >The standard practice in demagnetization is to measure the NRM and then to
subject the specimen to a series of demagnetization steps of increasing severity.
The magnetization of the specimen is measured after each step. During
demagnetization, the remanent magnetization vector will change until the most
stable component has been isolated, at which point the vector decays in a
straight line to the origin. This final component is called the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">characteristic</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">remanent magnetization </span>or ChRM.
<!--l. 499--><p class="noindent" >Visualizing demagnetization data is a three-dimensional problem and therefore
difficult to plot on paper. Paleomagnetists often rely on a set of two projections
of the vectors, one on the horizontal plane and one on the vertical plane. These
are variously called Zijderveld diagrams (Zijderveld, 1967), orthogonal
projections, or vector end-point diagrams.
<!--l. 511--><p class="noindent" >In orthogonal projections, the <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span

class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">3</span></sub>) (open symbols) in
another projection. The paleomagnetic convention differs from the usual x-y
                                                                     

                                                                     
plotting convention because <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">3</span></sub> is on a vertical axis which is positive in the
downward direction (instead of the usual positive up convention). The choice of
axis for the horizontal projection is a little more tricky. <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sub> is always positive to
the right of <span

class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub> is frequently plotted along the horizontal axis and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sub> would
then be on the vertical axis, again positive in the downward direction. The
paleomagnetic conventions make sense if one visualizes the diagram as a
map view for the solid symbols and a vertical projection for the open
symbols.
<!--l. 519--><p class="noindent" >Because <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">3</span></sub> gets plotted against whatever is chosen for the horizontal axis, the
angle that the vertical projection makes will only be true inclination if the
horizontal axis happens to be parallel to the remanence vector, i.e. directly along
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub>. For this reason, <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sub> is sometimes plotted along the horizontal axis if the
remanence vector is more parallel to <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sub>. Some people choose to plot the pairs of
points (<span

class="cmr-8">1</span></sub><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">,x</span><sub><span

the vector given by <img

   1    2"  class="sqrt" >. In this projection, sometimes called a
<span

step because <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">H </span>almost always changes direction, even if only slightly.
Plotting <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">H </span>versus <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">3</span></sub> is therefore a confusing and misleading practice. The
primary rationale for doing so is because, in the traditional orthogonal
projection where <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">3</span></sub> is plotted against <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub> or <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sub>, the vertical component
reveals only an apparent inclination. In fact, the choice of horizontal
component is arbitrary and could be deliberately chosen to be parallel to the
remanence directions. If something close to true inclination is desired, then,
instead of plotting <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">H </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">3</span></sub>, one can simply rotate the horizontal axes of
the orthogonal plot such that it closely parallels the desired declination
(Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900311">9.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zijd --></a>a,b).
<!--l. 532--><p class="noindent" >In the plots shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900311">9.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zijd --></a>a,c we have rotated the remanence vector
such that the <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub> component is parallel to the original NRM direction. In
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900311">9.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zijd --></a>, we show several general types of demagnetization behavior. In
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900311">9.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zijd --></a>a, the specimen has a North-Northwest and downward directed
NRM (see inset of equal area projection in geographic coordinates.) The
direction does not change during demagnetization and the NRM is a single
vector. The median destructive field (from Chapter 8) is illustrated in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900311">9.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zijd --></a>b. The specimen in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900311">9.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zijd --></a>c shows a progressive change in
direction from a Westward and up directed component to a North and
down direction. The vector continuously changes direction to the end and
no final &#8220;clean&#8221; direction has been confidently isolated. These data are
plotted on an equal area projection in the inset along with the trace of the
                                                                     

                                                                     
best-fitting plane (a great circle). The most stable component probably lies
somewhere near the best-fitting plane. This specimen came from the outcrop
depicted in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ch7.html#x9-7300119">7.19<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:lightning --></a> in Chapter 7 which had been hit by lightning.
The presumptive IRM is much &#8220;softer&#8221; on demagnetization; the NRM is
virtually erased by 40 mT, whereas the mdf of the specimen that had
not been hit by lightning is much higher (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900311">9.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zijd --></a>a,b). The NRM
of the lightning hit specimen is also more than an order of magnitude
stronger.
<!--l. 545--><p class="noindent" >The behavior of the specimen shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900311">9.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zijd --></a>d is again markedly different
in that the intensity, after an initial smooth decrease, begins to climb again at
high demagnetizing fields. The direction deflects away from the origin towards a
direction that is orthogonal to the last axis to be demagnetized. This
behavior is typical of GRM acquisition during demagnetization (see Chapter
7).
<!--l. 547--><p class="noindent" >When specimens acquire a remanence either along the axis of the oscillating field
(an ARM) or orthogonal to it (a GRM as in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-10900311">9.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zijd --></a>d) they require a more
complicated demagnetization regime than just along the three axes. In the
case of the parallel acquisition, a double demagnetization protocol works
well. In double demagnetization (e.g., Tauxe et al., 2004), a specimen is
subjected to demagnetization along the three orthogonal axes, say along

to give a GRM-free vector. This method is a simplified but at times
sufficient variation of the six step procedure described by Dankers and
Zijderveld (1981). GRMs have been associated with specimens that have a
high anisotropy (e.g., Stephenson, 1993; Tauxe et al., 2004; Potter and
Stephenson, 2005), or have a greigite magnetic remanence (e.g., Snowball,
1997).

href="#x11-10900311">9.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zijd --></a>b).
However, if there are several components with different directions, the intensity
decay curve cannot be used to determine, say, the blocking temperature
spectrum or mdf, because it is the vector sum of the two components.
It is therefore advantageous to consider the decay curve of the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">vector</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">difference sum </span>(VDS) of Gee et al. (1993). The VDS &#8220;straightens out&#8221;
the various components by summing up the vector differences at each
demagnetization step, so the total magnetization is plotted, as opposed to the
resultant.

<!--l. 699--><p class="nopar" >In addition to establishing that a given rock unit retains a consistent
magnetization, it is also important to establish when this magnetization was
acquired. Arguments concerning the age of magnetic remanence can be built on
indirect petrographic evidence as to the relative ages of various magnetic
minerals, or by evidence based on geometric relationships in the field. There are
two popular field tests that require special sampling strategies: the fold test and
the conglomerate test.
<!--l. 707--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">fold test </span>(also known as a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">tilt test</span>) relies on the tilting or folding of the target
geological material. If, for example, one wanted to establish the antiquity of a
particular set of directions, one could deliberately sample units of like
lithology, with different present attitudes (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-11200112">9.12<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:fold --></a>). If the recovered
directions are more tightly grouped before adjusting for tilt (as in the lower
left panel), then the magnetization is likely to have been acquired after
tilting. On the other hand, if directions become better grouped in the tilt
adjusted coordinates (see upper right panel), one has an argument in
favor of a pre-tilt age of the magnetization. Methods for quantifying the
tightness of grouping in various coordinate systems will be discussed in later
chapters.
<!--l. 725--><p class="noindent" >In the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">conglomerate test</span>, lithologies that are desirable for paleomagnetic purposes
must be found in a conglomerate bed (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-11300213">9.13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:conglom --></a>a). In this rare and happy
circumstance, we can sample them and show that: 1) the rock magnetic behavior
is the same for the conglomerate samples as for those being used in the
paleomagnetic study, 2) the directions of the studied lithology are well grouped,
(Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-11300213">9.13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:conglom --></a>b) and 3) the directions from the conglomerate clasts are randomly
oriented (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-11300213">9.13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:conglom --></a>d). If the directions of the clasts are not randomly
distributed (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x11-11300213">9.13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:conglom --></a>c), then presumably the conglomerate clasts (and, by
inference, the paleomagnetic samples from the studied lithology as well)
were magnetized after deposition of the conglomerate. We will discuss
statistical methods for deciding if a set of directions is random in later
chapters.
                                                                     

                                                                     
<!--l. 745--><p class="noindent" >The <span

href="#x11-11300414">9.14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:baked --></a>. It is similar to the
conglomerate test in that we seek to determine whether the lithology in question
has undergone pervasive secondary overprinting. When an igneous body intrudes
into an existing <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">host rock</span>, it heats (or bakes) the contact zone to above the Curie
temperature of the host rock. The baked contact immediately adjacent to the
intrusion should therefore have the same remanence direction as the intrusive
unit. This magnetization may be in an entirely different direction from the
pre-existing host rock. The maximum temperature reached in the baked zone
decreases away from the intrusion and remagnetization is not complete. Thus the
NRM directions of the baked zone gradually change from that of the intrusion to
that of the host rock. Such a condition would argue against pervasive
overprinting in the host rock that post-dated the intrusion, and the age of the
intrusion would provide an upper bound on the age of remanence in the host
rock.

20<sup><span

correction. To do this, first correct the NRM direction (and the pole to
bedding) for the plunge of the anticline. Rotate the fold axis to horizontal
first. Then complete the structural correction of the NRM direction by
restoring the bedding (corrected for plunge) to horizontal. Use the function

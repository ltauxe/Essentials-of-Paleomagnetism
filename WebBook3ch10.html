<!--l. 64--><p class="nopar" >The theoretical basis for how ancient magnetic fields might be preserved was laid
out by L. Néel (see Chapter 7). We expect thermal remanences of quasi-equant
single domain particles to be linearly related to the applied field for low fields like
the Earth&#8217;s (although elongate particles may not behave linearly even in low
fields). Larger particles of magnetite have more complicated remanent states
(flower, vortex, multi-domain) and TRM acquisition curves is more difficult to
predict from theory. However, empirical studies have shown that TRM
acquisition is significantly non-linear even at rather low field strengths and that
the departure from non-linearity is grain size dependent; the larger the particle,
the lower the field at which non-linearity becomes an issue (e.g., Dunlop and
Argyle, 1997). Nonetheless, the largest intensities on the Earth today
(<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>65 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BC;</span>T) are within the linear region for small equant particles and one
could reach several hundred microtesla before having to worry about
non-linearity. Therefore the linearity assumption appears to be reasonably
well founded for ideal assemblages. Indeed, the linearity assumption is
so deeply embedded in paleomagnetic practice that it is almost never
tested! However, it has recently become evident that naturally occurring
assemblages of single domain magnetite can have significantly non-linear
TRM acquisition behavior (Selkin et al., 2007), even for fields as low
as the Earth&#8217;s (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ch7.html#x9-660038">7.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:trm --></a>). Because the exact form of the TRM
acquisition depends critically on the magnetic assemblage, it would be
wisest to include a TRM acquisition experiment in any paleointensity
experiment.
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >There are several ways of checking the ability of the specimen to acquire TRM in
paleointensity experiments. In Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x12-11800010.1.1">10.1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sect:KTT --></a> we will discuss the step-wise
heating and <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Shaw </span>methods. Other approaches attempt to prevent the
alteration from occurring, for example by using microwaves to heat just the
magnetic phases, leaving the rest of the specimen cool, or by minimizing
the number of heating steps. Some methods attempt to normalize the
remanence with IRM and avoid heating altogether. We will briefly describe
                                                                     

                                                                     
each of these in turn, beginning with the step-wise heating family of
experiments. Regardless of method chosen, it is essential that as many of the
assumptions in the experiment be tested as possible. Experiments that skirt the
issues involved simply give us data whose reliability can not be verified
and, given all the things that can go wrong, such data are essentially
useless.

<!--l. 84--><p class="nopar" >A goal in paleointensity experiments since the earliest days has been the
detection of changes in the proportionality constant caused by alteration of the
magnetic phases in the rock during heating (e.g., Thellier and Thellier, 1959).
The basic idea is to heat specimens up in stages, progressively replacing the
natural remanence with partial thermal remanences. The step-wise heating
approach is particularly powerful when lower temperature steps are repeated, to
verify directly that the ability to acquire a thermal remenance has not
changed.
<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >The step-wise heating approach relies on the assumption that partial thermal
remanences (pTRMs) acquired by cooling between any two temperature steps

acquired between any other two temperature steps. This assumption is called the
<span

is the sum of all the independent pTRMs (see Figure&#x00A0;<a

Yet both experiment (Bol&#8217;shakov and Shcherbakova, 1979) and theory (e.g.,

imparted a pTRM over a narrow temperature interval of 370&#8211;350<sup><span

subjected the specimens to step-wise thermal demagnetization, monitoring the

<span

<!--l. 188--><p class="noindent" >What causes failure of reciprocity? If the particle is large enough to have domain
walls in its remanent state, the behavior is not easily understood by theory. At
just below its Curie Temperature the particle would be at saturation. As the
particle cools, domain walls will begin to form at some temperature. After
cooling all the way to room temperature, the remanent state, it will have some
net moment because the domain walls will distribute themselves such that there
is incomplete cancellation leaving a small net remanence proportional to the
applied field for moderate field strengths. As the temperature ramps up again,
the walls &#8220;walk around&#8221; within the particle, perhaps beginning below the
blocking temperature as they seek to minimize the magnetostatic energy. If the
particle is cooled back to room temperature, there could be a net loss of
magnetization, giving rise to low temparture tails. The walls may not actually be
destroyed until the temperature is very near the Curie Temperature and
some fraction of the pTRM could persist, giving rise to high temperature
tails.

<!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" >In order to detect inequality of blocking and unblocking and the effect of &#8220;pTRM

proposed and more are on the way. One modification is to alternate between the
IZ and ZI procedures (the so-called <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">IZZI method </span>of, e.g., Tauxe and Staudigel
(2004; see also Ben-Yosef et al., 2008). The protocol shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x12-1180045">10.5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:method --></a> not
only alternates ZI and IZ steps, but embeds a pTRM check step within
each ZI step. There is also a third zero field step inserted between the ZI
and IZ steps, labelled <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">pTRM-tail check</span>. This step was first described by
Dunlop and Özdemir (1997) but is usually attributed to Riisager and
Riisager (2001). It was designed to assess whether the partial thermal
remanence gained in the laboratory at a given temperature is completely
removed by re-heating to the same temperature. The difference between
the two zero-field steps is attributed to a &#8220;pTRM tail&#8221;. In the original
application, the absolute value of the difference was plotted on the vertical axis
(Dunlop and Özdemir, 1997; see also Riisager and Riisager, 2001) and was
interpreted to be a consequence of an inequality of the unblocking temperature
<span

class="cmmi-8">ub</span></sub> and the original blocking temperature <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">T</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">b</span></sub> in violation of the law of
reciprocity. The IZZI method is extremely sensitive to the presence of
pTRM tails which make the and/or Zijderveld diagrams &#8220;zig-zag&#8221; as in
the example of a complete IZZI experiment shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x12-1180056">10.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zigzag --></a>. The
zig-zag behavior was explained by Yu et al. (2004) as the effect of pTRM
tails.
<!--l. 233--><p class="noindent" >In Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x12-1180056">10.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:zigzag --></a>, we plot the pTRM tail checks from a typical experiment as blue
squares along the X axis; note that these are not absolute values, but are the
magnitudes of the differences in zero field steps separated by an in-field step at
the same temperature. We plot them this way because what is being measured is
a difference in the NRM remaining, not the pTRM. It is perhaps surprising that
most pTRM tails appear to be negative &#8211; not positive, suggesting the
dominance of low temperature tails, as opposed to high temperature
tails. Note also that the IZ steps are typically farther from the ideal line
than are the ZI steps. In any case, significant zig-zagging should raise
warning flags about the reliability of data acquired by such non-ideal
specimens.

<!--l. 247--><p class="noindent" >There are several other violations of the fundamental assumptions that require
additional tests and/or corrections in the paleointensity experiment besides
alteration or failure of reciprocity. For example, if the specimen is anisotropic
with respect to the acquisition of thermal remanence (e.g., Aitken et al., 1981),
the TRM can be strongly biased (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x12-1180067">10.7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:trm-anis --></a>). If this is the case, the TRM can
be corrected by determining the TRM (or the ARM proxy) anisotropy
tensor and matrix multiplication to recover the original magnetic vector
(see Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ch13.html#x15-16600013.7.1">13.7.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sect:aarm --></a> in Chapter 13 and Selkin et al., (2000), for a more
complete discussion.) One quick way of detecting if anisotropy might
be a problem is to compare the direction of the pTRM acquired in the
laboratory with the laboratory field direction, a parameter called <span

Appendix&#x00A0;<a

class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup>, the anisotropy tensor should
be determined. This will not work if the lab field is applied near the
principal direction where only a change in magnitude is expected, but
does work if the laboratory field is applied at an angle to the principal
direction.

approach to equilibrium is a function of time. Slower cooling results in a larger
TRM, hence differences in cooling rate between the original remanence
acquisition and that acquired in the laboratory will lead to erroneous results
(e.g., Halgedahl et al., 1980). Compensating for differences in cooling rate is
relatively straight-forward if the original cooling rate is known or can be
approximated and the specimens behave according to single domain theory (see

The full IZZI experiment, including TRM acquisition tests and perhaps
even TRM anisotropy or non-linear TRM acquisition tests involves many
heating steps (as many as 50!). Each time a specimen is heated, it is
exposed to the risk of alteration. Some experimental designs focus on
reducing the number of heating steps or the type of heating to minimize
the frequently catastrophic consequences of laboratory heating on the
results.
<!--l. 287--><p class="noindent" >There are a number of strategies for reducing the effects of laboratory heating.
These include using controlled atmospheres, reduced number of heating steps and
reduced heating of the matrix with microwaves focussed on the ferromagnetic

<!--l. 296--><p class="nopar" >Reducing the number of heating steps has been approached in several ways. Kono
and Ueno (1977) describe in detail a single heating step per temperature method
originally suggested by Kono (1974). Assuming that the specimen has a single
component of magnetization, which can be isolated after demagnetizing at some
low temperature (100<sup><span

The goal is that by reducing the number of heatings, the alteration can
be reduced to some extent. This method requires strictly uni-vectorial
NRMs (an assumption that is difficult to test with the data generated by
this method) and rather delicate positioning of specimens in the furnace
or fancy coil systems that generally have a limited region of uniform
field, reducing the number of specimens that can be analyzed in a single
batch. Steps like the pTRM checks and pTRM tail checks are possible
with this method, but they necessitate additional (zero field) heating
steps.

<!--l. 306--><p class="nopar" >A second strategy for reducing the number of heating steps is to treat multiple
specimens from a single cooling unit as a homogeneous set and expose each
specimen to a limited subset of all the heating steps required for a complete
paleointensity experiment. These &#8220;multi-specimen&#8221; techniques derive from one
proposed by Hoffman et al. (1989). Recent incarnations include Hoffman
and Biggin (2005) and Dekkers and Böhnel (2006). The basic idea is to
take multiple specimens from a given cooling unit and subject them to a
reduced number of heating steps. The data are stacked to yield a single
paleofield estimate. The Hoffman-Biggin (2005) method has some estimate of
the effects of alteration by including at least one double heating step.
The method of Dekkers and Böhnel (2006) is somewhat different in that
pTRMs are imparted at a temperature thought to exceed the overprint
unblocking but be less than the onset of chemical alteration. Each specimen is
treated in different laboratory field strength in a field parallel to the NRM
direction. This technique has been sold as being applicable to multi-domain
remanences, but the inequality of blocking and unblocking makes this invalid.
Moreover, there are few ways to check the assumptions of uni-vectorial
NRM, lack of alteration in the lab and the insidious effect of pTRM
tails.

we will briefly introduce an alternative approach, long in use in paleointensity

the Shaw method and the reader is referred to Tauxe and Yamazaki (2007) for a
recent review. In its simplest form, we measure the NRM, then progressively
demagnetize it with alternating fields (AF) to establish the coercivity
spectrum of the specimen prior to heating. The specimen is then given an
anhysteretic remanence (<span

it is analogous to the original TRM (see Dunlop and Özdemir, 1997).
<span

<!--l. 344--><p class="noindent" >There are many variants of the Shaw method that seek to improve reliability or
success rate and the reader is referred to a review by Tauxe and Yamazaki (2007)
for a more complete discussion. The primary reasons stated for using
Shaw-type methods as opposed to the theoretically more robust step-wise
heating methods are: 1) they are faster, and 2) because the specimen
is only heated once (albeit to a high temperature), alteration may be
minimized. The first rationale is no longer persuasive because modern
thermal ovens have high capacities and step-wise heating methods are
certainly not slower than the Shaw method on a per specimen basis, if
one analyzes lots of specimens. This is particularly true for the more
elaborate Shaw family protocols currently in use. The second rationale may
have some validity and warrants further work. The key features of any
good experiment are the built-in tests of the important assumptions and
current designs of Shaw type experiments do not build in the necessary
checks.
<!--l. 352--><p class="noindent" >Several alternative approaches have been proposed which instead of detecting
non-ideal behavior such as alteration, attempt to minimize it (see Tauxe and
Yamazaki, 2007 for more complete discussion). These methods include reducing
the number of heating steps required (as in the Shaw methods), heating
specimens in controlled atmospheres, reducing the time at temperature by for
example measuring the specimens at elevated temperature, or using microwaves
to excite spin moments as opposed to direct thermal heating. Of these, the
microwave paleointensity approach is perhaps the most popular and we will
briefly discuss that here.

moment of a particular grain becomes unblocked. Earlier, we mentioned
&#8220;thermal energy&#8221; and left it at that. But how does thermal energy do the

<!--l. 362--><p class="noindent" >An external magnetic field generates a torque on the electronic spins, and in
isolation, a magnetic moment will respond to the torque in a manner
similar in some respects to the way a spinning top responds to gravity: the
magnetic moment will precess about the applied field direction, spiraling
in and come to a rest parallel to it. Because of the strong exchange or
superexchange coupling in magnetic phases, spins tend to be aligned parallel (or
antiparallel) to one another and the spiraling is done in a coordinated
fashion, with neighboring spins as parallel as possible to one another.
This phenomenon is known as a spin wave (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ch3.html#x5-2800810">3.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:spinwave --></a> in Chapter
3).
<!--l. 366--><p class="noindent" >Raising the temperature of a body transmits energy (via <span

electronic spins, increasing the amplitude of the spin waves. This magnetic
energy is quantized in <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">magnons</span>. In the traditional step-wise heating experiment,
the entire specimen is heated and the spin waves are excited to the point
that some spin vectors may flip their moments as described in Chapter
7.
<!--l. 369--><p class="noindent" >As in most kitchens, there are two ways of heating things up: the conventional
oven and the microwave oven. In the microwave oven, molecules with certain
vibrational frequencies (e.g., water) are excited by microwaves. These heat up,
passing their heat on to the rest of the pizza (or whatever). If the right
microwave frequency is chosen, ferromagnetic particles can also be excited
directly, inviting the possibility of heating only the magnetic phases, leaving the
matrix alone (e.g., Walton et al., 1993). The rationale for developing this
method is to reduce the degree of alteration experienced by the specimen
because the matrix often remains relatively cool, while the ferromagnetic
particles themselves get hot. But, the magnons get converted to phonons,
thereby transferring the heat from the magnetic particle to the matrix
encouraging alteration (even melting sometimes!). So, while alteration
may in fact be reduced (see, e.g., Hill et al. 2005), it has not yet been
eradicated.
<!--l. 377--><p class="noindent" >The same issues of non-linearity, alteration, reciprocity, anisotropy and cooling
rate differences, etc., arise in the microwave approach as in the thermal
approach. Ideally, the same experimental protocol could be carried out with
microwave ovens as with thermal ovens. In practice, however, it has been quite
difficult to repeat the same internal temperature, making double (or even
quadruple) heatings challenging. Yet tremendous strides have been made
recently in achieving reproducible multiple heatings steps (e.g., Hill et al.,
2005).
                                                                     

                                                                     
<!--l. 381--><p class="noindent" >It is likely that the issues of reciprocity of blocking and unblocking in the original
(thermally blocked) and the laboratory (microwave unblocked) and differences in
the rate of blocking and unblocking will remain a problem for some time as they
have for thermally blocked remanences. It is also worth noting that the
theoretical equivalence between thermal unblocking and microwave unblocking
has not yet been demonstrated. Nonetheless, if alteration can be prevented by
this method, and the theoretical underpinnings can be worked out, it is well
worth pursuing.

<!--l. 387--><p class="nopar" >Another very important approach to the paleointensity problem has been to find
and exploit materials that are themselves resistant to alteration. There are an
increasing variety of promising materials, ranging from quenched materials, to
single crystals extracted from otherwise alteration prone rocks, to very slowly
cooled plutonic rocks (e.g., layered intrusions). Quenched materials include
volcanic glasses (e.g., Pick and Tauxe , 1993; Tauxe 2006), metallurgical slag
(e.g., Ben-Yosef et al., 2008) and welded tuffs (unpublished results). Single
crystals of plagioclase extracted from lava flows (see review by Tarduno et al.,
2006) can yield excellent results while the lava flows themselves may be prone to
alteration or other non-ideal behavior. Parts of layered intrusions (e.g., Selkin et
al., 2000b) can also perform extremely well during the paleointensity
experiment.

<!--l. 402--><p class="nopar" >Sometimes it is difficult or impossible to heat specimens because they will alter in
the atmosphere of the lab, or the material is too precious to be subjected to
heating experiments (e.g., lunar samples and some archaeological artifacts). If
TRM is linear with the applied field, there may be an alternative for order of
magnitude guesstimates for paleointensity without heating at all. TRM
normalized by a saturation remanence (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">M</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">r</span></sub>) can be quasi-linearly related to the
applied field up to some value depending on mineralogy and grain size
population.
                                                                     

                                                                     
<!--l. 404--><p class="noindent" >TRM/IRM can at best only give an order of magnitude estimate for absolute
paleointensity and that only for ideal, equant, and small SD magnetic
assemblages (see Chapter 7 for theoretical treatment). These strict constraints
may make even an order of magnitude guess unreliable. Finally, multi-domain
TRMs and IRMs do not respond similarly under AF demagnetization, the
former being much more stable than the latter. Nonetheless, if magnetic
uniformity can be established, it may in fact be useful for establishing relative
paleointensity estimates; thisis done routinely in sedimentary paleointensity
studies as we shall see later in the chapter. The caveats concerning single
component remanences are still applicable and perhaps complete AF
demagnetization of the NRM would be better than a single &#8220;blanket&#8221;
demagnetization step. Moreover, we should bear in mind that for larger particles,
TRM can be strongly non-linear with applied field at even relatively
low fields (30 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BC;</span>T) according to the experimental results of Dunlop and
Argyle (1997). The problem with the IRM normalization approach is that
domain state, linearity of TRM, and the nature of the NRM cannot be
assessed. The results are therefore difficult to interpret in terms of ancient
fields.

<!--l. 441--><p class="noindent" >Following from the introductory discussion of paleointensity in general, we
would require a laboratory redeposition experiment that duplicates the
natural remanence acquisition process in order to be able to determine
absolute paleointensity in sediments. The problem with sedimentary
paleointensity data is that laboratory conditions can rarely (if ever) achieve this.
Assuming that the remanence is not chemical but depositional in origin, the
intensity of remanence is still a complicated function of applied field,
magnetic mineralogy, concentration, and even chemistry of the water
column.
<!--l. 447--><p class="noindent" >Under the ideal conditions depicted in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x12-12800110">10.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drm --></a>, the initial DRM of a set of
specimens deposited under a range of magnetic field intensities (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">B</span>) is shown as
open circles. The relationship is not linear because each specimen has a
different response to the applied field (here called magnetic activity [<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">a</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">m</span></sub>])
as a result of differences in the amount of magnetic material, magnetic
mineralogy, etc. For example, specimens with a higher concentration of
magnetic material will have a higher DRM. If [<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">a</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">m</span></sub>] can be successfully
approximated, for example, by bulk remanences such as IRM or ARM, or by <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C7;</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">b</span></sub>
(Chapters 7 and Chapter 8), then a normalized DRM (shown as dots in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x12-12800110">10.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drm --></a>) will reflect at least the relative intensity of the applied
field.
<!--l. 463--><p class="noindent" >Our theoretical understanding of DRM is much less developed than for TRM
(Chapter 7). Because of the lack of a firm theoretical foundation for DRM, there
is no simple method for determining the appropriate normalization parameter. In
Chapters 7 and 8 we considered a variety of theoretical aspects of DRM and
various parameters potentially useful for normalization. Many proxies have been
proposed ranging from normalization by bulk magnetic properties such as ARM,
IRM, or <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C7;</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">b</span></sub> or more complicated proxies involving selective demagnetization of
the NRM or normalizer or both. One can imagine that even more sophisticated
normalization techniques could be devised by targeting particular coercivity
fractions discovered by the IRM component diagrams discussed in Chapter
8.
<!--l. 469--><p class="noindent" >Tauxe et al. (2006) summarized two major complications in our quest for
meaningful relative paleointensity estimates from sediments. First, the size of the
floc in which magnetic moments are embedded plays a huge role in the DRM
strength, yet estimating original floc size in sediments is a daunting task. Second,
DRM is only approximately linearly related to the applied field for the larger floc
sizes; small flocs or isolated magnetic particles are likely to be highly non-linear
                                                                     

                                                                     
in their magnetic response.
<!--l. 471--><p class="noindent" >How can sedimentary relative paleointensity data be judged? Here are some
thoughts:
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x12-128003x1">The  natural  remanence  must  be  carried  by  a  detrital  phase  of
     high  magnetic  stability.  Furthermore,  the  portion  of  the  natural
     remanent  vector  used  for  paleointensity  should  be  a  single,  well
     defined  component  of  magnetization.  The  nature  of  the  NRM  can
     be checked with progressive demagnetization using AF and thermal
     techniques.  Supplementary  information  from  hysteresis  and  rock
     magnetic experiments can also be useful.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x12-128005x2">The  detrital  remanence  must  be  an  excellent  recorder  of  the
     geomagnetic field, exhibit no inclination error and if both polarities
     are present the two populations should be antipodal. The associated
     directional data must therefore be plotted on equal area projections
     whenever they are available.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x12-128007x3">Large  changes  in  concentration  (more  than  about  an  order  of
     magnitude) and any change in magnetic mineralogy or grain size will
     foil attempts at normalization. These changes can be detected with
     the use of bi-plots of, for example, IRM and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C7; </span>(see Chapter 8). Such
     bi-plots should be linear, with low scatter.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x12-128009x4">The relative paleointensity estimates that are coherent with bulk rock
     magnetic parameters should be treated with caution. Coherence can
     be assessed using standard spectral techniques.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x12-128011x5">Records from a given region should be coherent within the limits of
     a common time scale. Whenever possible duplicate records should be
     obtained and compared.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x12-128013x6">For  a  relative  paleointensity  record  to  have  the  maximum  utility,
     it   should   have   an   independent   time   scale.   Many   deep   sea
     sediment  records  are  calibrated  using  oxygen  isotopic  curves  or
                                                                     

                                                                     
     magnetostratigraphic age constraints (or both). Lake sediments are
     more difficult to date and rely for the most part on radiocarbon ages.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x12-128015x7">Changes in water chemistry (pH and salinity) and changes in clay
     mineralogy or concentration can have a huge effect on the tendency
     to flocculate. Such changes are likely to have a profound effect on
     the DRM, yet may be difficult to detect after the fact. Low salinity
     environments (lakes) are particularly sensitive to this problem. In any
     case, all studies should probably attempt to characterize changes in
     the clay fraction, yet very few (if any) have done so to date.</li></ol>

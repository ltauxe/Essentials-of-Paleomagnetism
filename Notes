To convert the book into html:

-Open terminal -Change to the directory with WebBook2.tex -Type command
' htlatex WebBook2 "html, 1, sections+" ' (This is the equivalent of
running LaTeX, BibTex, LaTex, LaTex, tex4ht, t4ht).  For the options,
you will always want 'html'.  1-4 will determine how many html documents
you generate -- if you choose 1, you will get one big html document;
with 2 you will get a html document for each chapter; with 3 a document
for each section; with 4 a document for each subsection.

-To generate a list of the customlinks, use the command "cat
WebBook2.log | grep Customlinks > index_of_links.txt"  You can name the
.txt file whatever you want, and it will be created.

Tricks for LaTeX to html:

-Customlinks.  Download Customlinks package, and include customlinks.tex document in the directory you will be working with.  Include this in the LaTeX document:
 \begin{document}
 \input{customlinks.tex} % comment these out for book version
 \newcommand{\be}{\begin{equation}}% comment these out for book version
 \newcommand{\ee}{\end{equation}}% comment these out for book version

-To create a customlink, put this command into the .tex document
"/customlink{name_of_link}.  This will create a named anchor in the html
that looks like this: WebBook2.html#name_of_link.  This can be
referenced in other websites.

-To include a link, include \usepackage{hyperref} in the preamble.  

-To put a link into the text, use the command
"/url{http://www.website.com}".  The link must begin with http://.  This
will show up in the html as: http://www.website.com, and it will be a
clickable link.

-To put clickable text other than the link into the text, use the
command "/href{http://www.website.com}{Interesting Website}.  This
will show up in the html as: Interesting Website, and it will also be
clickable and will direct you to http://www.website.com.

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">1 Purpose of the book</span>
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   The geomagnetic field acts both as an umbrella, shielding us from
cosmic radiation and as a window, offering one of the few glimpses of
the inner workings of the Earth. Ancient records of the geomagnetic
field can inform us about geodynamics of the early Earth and changes
in boundary conditions through time. Thanks to its essentially dipolar
nature, the geomagnetic field has acted as a guide, pointing to the axis of
rotation thereby providing latitudinal information for both explorers and
geologists.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Human measurements of the geomagnetic field date to about a millenium and
are quite sparse prior to about 400 years ago. Knowledge of what the field has
done in the past relies on accidental records carried by geological and
archaeological materials. Teasing out meaningful information from such
materials requires an understanding of the fields of rock magnetism and
paleomagnetism, the subjects of this book. Rock and paleomagnetic data are
useful in many applications in Earth Science in addition to the study
of the ancient geomagnetic field. This book attempts to draw together
essential rock magnetic theory and useful paleomagnetic techniques in a
consistent and up-to-date manner. It was written for several categories of
readers:

<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   There are a number of excellent references on paleomagnetism and on the
related specialties (rock magnetism and geomagnetism). The ever popular but
now out of print text by Butler (1992) has largely been incorporated into the
present text. For in-depth coverage of rock magnetism, we recommend Dunlop
and Özdemir (1997). Similarly for geomagnetism, please see Backus et al. [1996].
A rigorous analysis of the statistics of spherical data is given by Fisher et al.
(1987). The details of paleomagnetic poles are covered in van der Voo (1993)
and magnetostratigraphy is covered in depth by Opdyke and Channell
(1996). The Treatise in Geophysics, vol. 5 (edited by Kono, 2007) and The
Encyclopedia of Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism (edited by Gubbins and
Herrero-Bervera, 2007) have up to date reviews of many topics covered in this
book. The present book is intended to augment or distill information from
the broad field of paleomagnetism, complementing the existing body of
literature.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   An important part of the problems in this book is to teach students to write
simple computer programs themselves and use programs that are supplied as a
companion set of software (<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">PmagPy</span>). The programming language chosen for
this is Python because it is free, cross platform, open source and well
supported. There are excellent online tutorials for Python and many open
source modules which make software development cheaper and easier than
any other programming environment. The appendix provides a brief
introduction to programming and using Python. The reader is well advised
to peruse the <a 
href="http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/" >PmagPy Cookbook</a> for further help in gaining necessary
skills with a computer. Also, students should have access to a relatively
new computer (Windows, Mac OS 10.4 or higher are supported, but
other computers may also work.) Software installation is described at:

<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">2 What is in the book</span>
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   This book is a collaborative effort with contributions from R.F. Butler
(Chapters 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11 and the Appendix), S.K Banerjee (Chapter 8) and
R. van der Voo (Chapter 16). The MagIC database team designed and deployed
the MagIC database which we have made liberal use of in providing data for
problem sets and in the writing of the <a 
href="http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/" >PmagPy Cookbook</a>, so there were
significant contributions to this book project from C.G. Constable, A.A.P.
Koppers and Rupert Minnett.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   At the beginning of most chapters, there are recommended readings which
will help fill in background knowledge. There are also suggested readings at the
end of most chapters that will allow students to pursue the subject matter in
more depth.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   The chapters themselves contain the essential theory required to understand
paleomagnetic research as well as illustrative applications. Each chapter is
followed by a set of practical problems that challenge the student&#8217;s understanding
of the material. Many problems use real data and encourage students to analyze
the data themselves. [Solutions to the problems may be obtained from LT by
instructors of classes using this book as a text.] The appendix contains detailed
derivations, assorted techniques, useful tables and a comprehensive explanation
of the <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">PmagPy </span>set of programs.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   Chapter 1 begins with a review of the physics of magnetic fields.
Maxwell&#8217;s equations are introduced where appropriate and the magnetic
units are derived from first principles. The conversion of units between
cgs and SI conventions is also discussed and summarized in a handy
table.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Chapter 2 reviews essential aspects of the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field,
discussing the geomagnetic potential, geomagnetic elements, and the
geomagnetic reference fields. The various magnetic poles of the Earth are also
introduced.
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   Chaptes 3-8 deal with rock and mineral magnetism. The most important
aspect of rock magnetism to the working paleomagnetist is how rocks can become
magnetized and how they can stay that way. In order to understand this,
Chapter 3 presents a discussion of the origin of magnetism in crystals, including
induced and remanent magnetism. Chapter 4 continues with an explanation of
anisotropy energy, magnetic domains and superparamagnetism. Magnetic
hysteresis is covered in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 deals with specific magnetic
minerals and their properties, leading up to the origin of magnetic remanence in
rocks, the topic of Chapter 7. Finally Chapter 8 deals with applied rock
magnetism and environmental magnetism.
                                                                     

                                                                     
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   Chapters 9-13 delve into the nuts and bolts of paleomagnetic data acquisition
and analysis. Chapter 9 suggests ways of sampling rocks in the field and methods
for treating them in the laboratory to obtain a paleomagnetic direction. Various
techniques for obtaining paleointensities are described in Chapter 10. Once the
data are in hand, Chapters 11 and 12 deal with statistical methods for
analyzing magnetic vectors. Paleomagnetic tensors are introduced in
Chapter 13, which explains measurement and treatment of anisotropy
data.
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Chapters 14-16 illustrate diverse applications of paleomagnetic data. Chapter
14 shows how they are used to study the geomagnetic field. Chapter 15 describes
the development of the geomagnetic polarity time scale and various applications
of magnetostratigraphy. Chapter 16 focuses on apparent polar wander and
tectonic applications.
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   The appendix contains more detailed information, included for supplemental
background or useful techniques. It is divided into several sections: Appendix&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">??</span>
summarizes various definitions and detailed derivations including various
mathematical tricks such as vector and tensor operations. Appendix&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">??</span> describes
some plots commonly employed by paleomagnetists. Appendix&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">??</span> collects
together methods and tables useful in directional statistics. Appendix&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">??</span>
describes techniques specific to the measurement and analysis of anisotropy data.
The <a 
href="http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/" >PmagPy Cookbook</a> provides an introduction to the Magnetics Information
Consortium (MagIC) database, the current repository for rock and paleomagnetic
data and summarizes essential computer skills including basic Unix commands,
an introduction to Python programming and extensive examples of programs in
the <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">PmagPy </span>software package used in the problems at the end of each
chapter.
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">3 How to use the book</span>
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   Each chapter builds on the principles outlined in the previous chapters, so the
reader is encouraged to work through the book sequentially. There are
recommended readings before and after every chapter selected to provide
backgound information and supplemental reading for the motivated reader
respectively. These are meant to be optional.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   The reader is encouraged to study Chapter 6 in the <a 
href="http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/" >PmagPy Cookbook</a>
before beginning to work on the problems at the end of each chapter. The utility
of the book will be greatly enhanced by successfully installing and using the
programs referred to in the problems. By conscientiously trying them out
as they are mentioned, the reader will not only gain familiarity with
<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">PmagPy </span>software package, but also with the concepts discussed in the
chapters.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   We have attempted to maintain a consistent notation throughout the book.
                                                                     

                                                                     
Vectors and tensors are in bold face; other parameters, including vector
components, are in italics. The most important physical and paleomagnetic
parameters, acronyms and statistics are listed in Appendix&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">??</span>.
<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">4 Acknowledgements</span>
<!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   LT is the primary author of this book who bears sole responsibility for all
mistakes. There are significant contributions by RFB, SKB and RvdV.
We are indebted to many people for assistance great and small. This
book began life as a set of lecture notes based loosely on the earlier book
by Tauxe (1998). Many pairs of eyes hunted down errors in the text
and the programs each time the course was given. The course was also
occasionally co-taught with Cathy Constable and Jeff Gee who contributed
significantly to the development of the manuscript and the proof-reading
there-of. Thanks go to the many &#8220;live&#8221; and &#8220;online&#8221; students who patiently
worked through various drafts. Special thanks go to Kenneth Yuan, Liu
Cy , Maxwell Brown and Michael Wack who provided many detailed
comments and helpful suggestions. Reviews by Ken Kodama, Brad Clement,
Scott Bogue and Cor Langereis improved the book substantially. Also,
careful proof-reading by Newlon Tauxe of the first few chapters is greatly
appreciated.
<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >   I owe a debt of gratitude to the many sources of public domain software that
ended up in the package <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">PmagPy</span>, including contributions by Peter Selkin, Ron
Shaar and Ritayan Mitra as well as the many dedicated contributors to the
Numpy, Matplotlib, and Basemap Python modules used extensively by
<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">PmagPy. </span>Also, many illustrations were prepared with the excellent programs
<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Magmap, Contour </span>and <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Plotxy </span>by Robert L. Parker, to whom I remain deeply
grateful. I gratefully acknowledge the authors of many earlier books, too many to
name but included in the Bibliography, which both educated and inspired
me.
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   Finally, I am grateful to my husband, Hubert Staudigel, and my children,
Philip and Daniel Staudigel who have long tolerated my obsession with
paleomagnetism with grace and good humor and frequently good advice.

<!--l. 5--><p class="nopar" >BACKGROUND: read Widom (2002), Chapter 1.
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >The key to the acquisition of magnetic remanence is magnetic anisotropy energy,
the dependence of magnetic energy on direction of magnetization within the
crystal ( see Chapter 4). It is magnetic anistotropy energy that controls the
probability of magnetic grains changing their moments from one easy
direction to another. Without it, the magnetic moments of individual grains
would swing freely and could not retain a &#8220;memory&#8221; of the ancient field
direction.
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >Anisotropy energy controls relaxation time, a concept briefly introduced in
Chapter 4 where we defined it as a time constant for decay of the magnetization
of an assemblage of magnetic grains when placed in a null field. Equation&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ch4.html#x6-39002r10">4.10<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:MvT --></a>
predicted exponential decay with relaxation time <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4; </span>being the time it
takes for the initial magnetization to decay to 1<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x2215;e </span>of its initial value.
Relaxation time reflects the probability of magnetic moments jumping over the
anisotropy energy barrier between easy axes. Therefore, to preserve a
record of an ancient geomagnetic field, there must be a way that the
relaxation time changes from short (such that the magnetization is in
equilibrium with the ambient geomagnetic field) to long (such that the
magnetization is &#8220;frozen&#8221;, or blocked, for geologically significant periods of
time).
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >Before we begin a more detailed look at the processes governing remanence
acquisition, it is helpful to review briefly what is meant by &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; in
physics and chemistry. Eager students are encouraged to read the background
material recommended in the &#8220;BACKGROUND&#8221; list at the beginning of the
chapter. In the following, we will go through the bare bones of statistical
mechanics necessary to understand natural remanence.

<!--l. 28--><p class="nopar" >We live in a world that is in constant motion down to the atomic level. The state
of the things is constantly changing, but, looking at the big picture, things
often seem to stay the same. Imagine for a moment a grassy field full of
sheep and a fence running down the middle. The sheep can jump over the
fence at will to get flowers on the other side and occasionally they do
so. Over time, because the two sides of the fence are pretty much the
same, the same number of sheep jump over in both directions, so if you
were to count sheep on either side, the numbers would stay about the
same.

will  be  on  either  side  of  the  fence,  despite  the  fact  that  sheep  are
constantly  jumping  over  the  fence.  If  one  side  is  preferable  (sunny

<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" ></div><hr class="endfigure">
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >Now think about what would happen if it were raining on one side of the fence.
The sheep would jump more quickly back over the fence from the rainy side to
the sunny side than the other way around. You might find that over time, there
were more sheep on the sunny side than on the rainy side (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x9-630011">7.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:equilibrium --></a>). If you
are still awake after all this sheep counting, you have begun to understand the
concept of dynamic equilibrium.
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Returning to magnetism, a magnet with uniaxial anisotropy in the absence of a
magnetic field will tend to be magnetized in one of several possible &#8220;easy&#8221;
directions (see Chapter 4). For the purpose of this discussion, let us consider the
case of uniaxial anisotropy, in which there are only two easy directions in each
magnetic grain. In order to &#8220;jump over the fence&#8221; (the anisotropy energy) and
get from one easy axis to another, a magnetic particle must have thermal
energy in excess of the anisotropy energy. According to the Boltzmann
distribution law, the probability of a given particle having an energy <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">E </span>is
proportional to <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">e</span><sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">-</span><span 
class="cmmi-8">E&#x2215;kT</span> </sup> where <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">kT </span>is the thermal energy (see Chapter
4). Therefore, it may be that at a certain time, a particular magnetic
grain has enough thermal energy for the electronic spins to overcome the
energy barrier and flip the sense of magnetization from one easy axis to
another.
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >If we had a collection of magnetized particles with some initial statistical
alignment of moments giving a net remanence <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">M</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sub>, (more sheep on one side than
the other), the random &#8220;fence jumping&#8221; by magnetic moments from one easy axis
to another over time will eventually lead to the case where there is no
preference and the net moment will have decayed to zero (although the
individual grain moments remain at saturation). This approach to <span

<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">magnetization </span>(<span

<!--l. 73--><p class="nopar" >The theoretical basis for how ancient magnetic fields might be preserved was
established over fifty years ago with the work of Nobel prize winner Louis Néel
(1949, 1955).  In the introduction to this chapter, we suggested that the
mechanism which controls the approach to magnetic equilibrium is relaxation
time. In the sheep analogy this would be the frequency of fence jumping. We
defined relaxation time by Equation&#x00A0;<a 
href="WebBook3ch4.html#x6-39003r11">4.11<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:tau --></a> in Chapter 4, sometimes called the
<span

class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4; </span>to volume <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">v</span>, the anisotropy constant (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">K</span>) and
absolute temperature (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">T</span>).
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >Relaxation time is controlled by the competition between anisotropy

space. Figure&#x00A0;<a

class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4;</span>s ranging from <span

seconds to the age of the Earth. The inset to Figure&#x00A0;<a

the effect of temperature on the iso-<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C4;</span>s, which move up and to the right
with increasing temperature. This behavior gives us a clue as to how a
rise in temperature could change a &#8220;blocked&#8221; remanence at 0<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup>C (273K)
(one that is stable for long periods of time) to an unblocked one. In fact,
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x9-630022">7.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:neel --></a>b (and the inset) suggests two other ways of manipulating the
approach to equilibrium besides temperature: by changing the time span of
observation and by changing grain volume. Each of these mechanisms
represents a different mode of remanence acquisition (thermal, viscous, and
chemical remanences respectively). Naturally acquired remanences are
generally referred to as <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">natural remanent magnetizations </span>or NRMs. In this
chapter we will introduce these and other forms of NRM and how they
are acquired. We will also introduce useful unnatural remanences where
appropriate.

function of the applied field. This tendency is reflected in the more general form

us that the longer we wait, the more likely it is for a given magnetic

the critical blocking energy line migrates up and to the right (moving

relaxation time depends on thermal energy, so higher temperatures will result
in lower blocking temperatures. Second, anisotropy energy depends on
the square of magnetization (Chapter 4). Elevated temperature reduces
magnetization, so the anisotropy energy will be depressed relative to
lower temperatures. In the diagram, this means that not only do the
relaxation time curves move with changing temperature, but the anisotropy
energies of the population of grains change as well. This means that a
population of grains that are superparamagnetic at high temperature
(Figure&#x00A0;<a

<!--l. 292--><p class="noindent" >Now let us put some of these concepts into practice. Consider a lava flow which
has just been extruded (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x9-660017">7.7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:lava --></a>a). Upon meeting the chilly air (or water),
molten lava solidifies quickly into rock. While the rock is above the Curie
Temperature, there is no remanent magnetization; thermal energy dominates the
system and the system behaves as a paramagnet. As the rock cools through the
Curie Temperature of its magnetic phase, exchange energy becomes more
important and the magnetic minerals become ferromagnetic. The magnetization,
however, is free to track the prevailing magnetic field because anisotropy energy
is still less important than the magnetostatic energy. The magnetic grains are
superparamagnetic and the magnetization is in magnetic equilibrium with the
ambient field.
<!--l. 313--><p class="noindent" >The magnetic moments in the lava flow tend to flop from one easy direction to
another, with a slight statistical bias toward the direction with the minimum
angle to the applied field (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x9-660017">7.7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:lava --></a>c). Thus, the equilibrium magnetization of
superparamagnetic grains is not fully aligned, but only slightly aligned, and the
degree of alignment is a linear function of the applied field for low fields like the
Earth&#8217;s. The magnetization approaches saturation at higher fields (from <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~ </span>0.2 T
to several tesla, depending on the details of the source of anisotropy
energy).
<!--l. 325--><p class="noindent" >Recalling the energy difference between the two easy axes of a magnetic
particle in the presence of a magnetic field (Equation&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x9-65001r3">7.3<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:deltaE --></a>), we can estimate
the fraction of saturation for an equilibrium magnetization at a given
temperature. Applying the Boltzmann distribution law to the theory of thermal
remanence, we take &#x0394;<span

and the other antiparallel to the applied field <span

useful feature of pTRMs in single domain grains is that their blocking

<!--l. 459--><p class="noindent" >Perhaps the most severe simplification in the above model of TRM acquisition is
that it considers only single-domain grains. Given the restricted range of grain
size and shape distributions for stable SD grains of magnetite or titanomagnetite
(see Chapter 4), at most a small percentage of grains in a typical igneous rock
are truly SD. The question then arises as to whether larger grains can acquire
TRM.

grains in 1-2 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BC;</span>m range do acquire TRM that can be stable against time decay
and against demagnetization by later magnetic fields. This observation is the
source of the term pseudo-single domain (PSD; see also Chapter 5) which
characterizes the behavior of grains that are too large to be truly single
domain, yet do exhibit stability unexpected for grains with domain walls
(MD grains). The physics of PSD grains is much more complicated than
for SD grains and is not fully understood (see Section&#x00A0;<a

discussion.)
<!--l. 471--><p class="noindent" >For grains larger than a few microns, the acquisition of TRM is very inefficient.
In addition, TRM in these larger grains can be quite unstable; they are prone to
acquire viscous magnetization. SD and PSD grains are the effective carriers of
TRM, while larger MD grains are likely to carry a component of magnetization
acquired long after original cooling.
<!--l. 475--><p class="noindent" >Rapidly cooled volcanic rocks generally have grain-size distributions with a major
portion of the distribution within SD and PSD ranges. Also deuteric oxidation of
volcanic rocks can produce intergrowth grains with effective magnetic grain size
less than the magnetic grains that crystallized from the igneous melt. Thus,
volcanic rocks are commonly observed to possess fairly strong and stable TRM.
A typical intensity of TRM in a basalt flow is 1 Am<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">-</span><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sup>. Because grain size
depends in part on cooling rate of the igneous body, rapidly cooled extrusive
rocks are frequently preferable to slowly cooled intrusive rocks. However,
exsolution processes can break what would have been unsuitable MD magnetic
grains into ideal strips of SD-like particles (see Chapter 6) so there is no
universal rule as to which rocks will behave in the ideal single domain
manner.

<!--l. 667--><p class="noindent" >The tendency to flocculate increases with increasing salinity. There are therefore
two completely different systems when discussing DRM: ones in which magnetic
particles remain essentially isolated or embedded in very small flocs (e.g., in
freshwater lakes; see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x9-6900414">7.14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drmprocesses --></a>a) and ones in which flocculation plays a role
(e.g., marine environments; see Figure&#x00A0;<a

freshwater, Brownian motion may reduce DRM efficiency and give rise to
the dependence on <span

control on DRM is the size of the flocs in which the magnetic particles are
embedded. In the following we briefly explore these two very different
environments.

magnetic moments are presumably a saturation remanence. Although,
even in fresh water, the magnetic particles are likely to be attached to
clays through van der Waals attraction the clays themselves have no
great mutual attraction. It is possible, therefore that magnetic particles
could be subject to Brownian motion. Here we outline the theory to
investigate the behavior of DRM that would be expected from a Brownian

<!--l. 756--><p class="noindent" >The flocculation model of DRM makes specific predictions which can in principle
be tested if the model parameters can be estimated or controlled. Tauxe
et al. (2006) tested the flocculation hypothesis by dispersing natural
sediments in settling tubes to which varying amounts of NaCl had been
introduced. Prior to dispersal, each specimen of mud was given a saturation
remanence. They measured DRM as a function of salinity (and therefore
floc size) and the applied field (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x9-7100117">7.17<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drm-exp --></a>). In general their results
suggested the following: 1) the higher the salinity, the lower the net moment
and the faster the particles settled, 2) the higher the applied field, the
higher the net moment, although a saturation DRM appeared to be nearly
achieved in the 1 ppt NaCl set of tubes by 30 <span

cases, and 4) the saturation DRM was less than the saturation IRM so
the simplest idea of one floc/one magnetic particle failed to explain the

by chance encounters with other flocs, the net moment of the composite floc will
be the vector sum of the moments of the fundamental flocs. Tauxe et al. (2006)
used the composite floc hypothesis to model experimental DRMs (see examples

<!--l. 775--><p class="nopar" >It appears that by combining the effects of Brownian motion for non-flocculating
environments and a composite floc model for flocculating environments we are on
the verge of a quantitative physical theory that can account for the acquisition of
depositional remanence near the sediment/water interface. The DRM will be
fixed when no further physical rotation of the magnetic particles in response
to the geomagnetic field is possible. The depth at which moments are
pinned is called the lock-in depth. In the &#8220;standard model&#8221; of depositional
remanence (DRM) acquisition (see, e.g.,  Verosub, 1977) detrital remanence is
acquired by locking in different grains over a range of depths. This phased
lock-in leads to both significant smoothing and to an offset between the
sediment/water interface and the fixing of the DRM. Many practitioners of
paleomagnetism still adhere to this concept of DRM which stems from the
early laboratory redeposition experiments which were carried out under
non-flocculating conditions, however. As summarized by  Tauxe et al. (2006), the
evidence for substantial smoothing and a deep (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x003E;</span>10 cm) lock in remains
weak.
<!--l. 785--><p class="noindent" >Physical rotation of particles in response to compaction can also change the
magnetic remanence. As sediments lose water and consolidate, compaction can
have a strong effect on DRM intensity (e.g.,  Anson and Kodama, 1987).
Consolidation is a continuous process starting from the sediment water interface
when sedimentary particles first gel (see, e.g., Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x9-6900414">7.14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:drmprocesses --></a>b) and continuing until
the sediment is completely compacted, perhaps as deep as hundreds of meters.
The effect on magnetic remanence depends on volume loss during compaction
which depends largely on clay content, so clay rich sediments will have the largest
effect.
<!--l. 791--><p class="noindent" >Other processes not involving post-depositional physical rotation of magnetic
particles including &#8220;viscous&#8221; (in the sense of magnetic viscosity) remagnetization
and diagenetic alteration resulting in a chemical remanence may also modify the
DRM. All of these processes influence the intensity of remanence and hamper our
efforts to decipher the original geomagnetic signal.

some fraction (<span

inclination error is at a maximum at 45<sup><span

the strongest remanences in horizontal fields and the weakest in vertical
fields.

relaxation time on the coercivity of magnetic particles. We can coax the
magnetization of otherwise firmly entrenched particles to follow an applied field,
if that field is larger than the coercivity. Exposing a particle to a large magnetic
field, will allow magnetic particles whose coercivity is below that field to flip their
magnetic moments to a direction at a more favorable angle to the applied field,
resulting in a gain in magnetic remanence in that direction. This type of
magnetic remanence is called an <span

<!--l. 966--><p class="nopar" >Another way to magnetize rocks (although not in nature) is to subject a sample
to an alternating field (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x9-7600122">7.22<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:arm --></a>). Particles whose coercivity is lower than
the peak oscillating field will flip and flop along with the field. These entrained
moments will become stuck as the peak field gradually decays below
the coercivities of individual grains. Assuming that there is a range of
coercivities in the sample, the low stability grains will be stuck half along one
direction of the alternating field and half along the other direction; the net
contribution to the remanence will be zero. This is the principle of so-called
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">alternating field (AF) demagnetization </span>which we will discuss in later
chapters.
<!--l. 976--><p class="noindent" >If there is a small DC bias field superposed on the alternating field, then there
will be a statistical preference in the remagnetized grains for the direction of the
bias field, analogous to TRM acquired during cooling. This net magnetization is
termed the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">anhysteretic remanent magnetization </span>or ARM. By analogy to partial
thermal remanence, one can impart a partial anhysteretic remanence (pARM) by
only turning on the DC field for part of the AF cycle (solid blue line in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x9-7600122">7.22<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:arm --></a>). Also, by normalizing the magnetization (volume normalized with
units of Am<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">-</span><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sup>) by the DC field (also converted to Am<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">-</span><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sup>), one has the
dimensionless parameter known as ARM susceptibility (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C7;</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">ARM</span></sub>). This parameter
assumes that ARM is linearly related to the inducing field so that <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03C7;</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">ARM</span></sub> is
independent of the applied field. This is of course only true for small DC fields
and may not be true for the fields used in most laboratories (50-100
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BC;</span>T).
<!--l. 983--><p class="noindent" >A related remanence known as the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">gyromagnetic remanent magnetization </span>or
GRM is a somewhat mysterious remanence that is acquired by stationary
specimens in moving fields or by rotating specimens in either steady or moving
fields. It is most frequently observed as a component of magnetization acquired
during alternating field demagnetization that is perpendicular to the last axis of
demagnetization. It was originally thought to arise from the gyroscopic response
of SD moments to the torque of an applied field which, in anisotropic
distributions of SD moments resulted in a net moment perpendicular to the
                                                                     

                                                                     
applied field (Stephenson, 1981). But, truly uniaxial single domain particles will
have no net remanence if demagnetized along all three axes, no matter how
anisotropic the distribution of easy axes is. More recently,  Potter and
Stephenson (2005) hypothesized that small deviations from the uniaxial
constraint for small acicular magnetic particles could explain the behavior.
They performed experiments on elongate particles of maghemite (1 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BC;</span>m in
length and 0.22 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BC;</span>m in diameter) and confirmed that the non-ideal (not
strictly uniaxial) behavior could explain the GRM. They referred to these
particles as being single domain, and while they may not have had domain
walls, it is likely that such large particles were in fact in the size range
that exhibit vortex remanent states (see Chapter 4). It is therefore likely
that anisotropic distributions of vortex state particles is the cause of
GRM.

(for example during deep burial). The grains with relaxation times (at the

laboratory time scales of, say, 100 seconds, we need to know the blocking

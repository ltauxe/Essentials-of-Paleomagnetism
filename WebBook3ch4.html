<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >Rocks often contain assemblages of ferromagnetic minerals dispersed within a
matrix of diamagnetic and paramagnetic minerals. In later chapters we will be
concerned with the magnetization of these assemblages, but here we continue our
investigation of the behavior of individual particles. In Chapter 3 we learned that
in some crystals electronic spins work in concert to create a spontaneous
magnetization that remains in the absence of an external field. The basis of
paleomagnetism is that these ferromagnetic particles carry the record of
ancient magnetic fields. What allows the magnetic moments to come into
equilibrium with the geomagnetic field and then what fixes that equilibrium
magnetization into the rock so that we may measure it millions or even billions of
years later? We will begin to answer these questions over the next few
chapters.
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >We will start with the second part of the question: what fixes magnetizations in
particular directions? A basic principle is that ferromagnetic particles have
various contributions to the magnetic energy which controls their magnetization.
No matter how simple or complex the combination of energies may become, the
grain will seek the configuration of magnetization which minimizes its total
energy. The short answer to our question is that certain directions within
magnetic crystals are at lower energy than others. To shift the magnetization
from one &#8220;easy&#8221; direction to another requires energy. If the barrier is
high enough, the particle will stay magnetized in the same direction
for very long periods of time &#8211; say billions of years. In this chapter we
will address the causes and some of the consequences of these energy
barriers for the magnetization of rocks. Note that in this chapter we will be
dealing primarily with energy densities (volume normalized energies),
as opposed to energy and will distinguish the two by the convention
that energies are given with the symbol <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">E </span>and energy densities with
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03F5;</span>.
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >In Chapter 6, we will discuss the behavior of common magnetic minerals, but to
develop the general theory, it is easiest to focus on a single mineral. We
choose here the most common one, magnetite. It has a simple, cubic
structure and has been the subject intensive study. However, we will
occasionally introduce concepts appropriate for other magnetic minerals where
appropriate.
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >The simplest permanently magnetized particles are quasi-uniformly magnetized.
These so-called <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">single domain </span>(SD) particles have spins that act in concert,
staying as parallel (or anti-parallel) as possible. As particles get larger, the
                                                                     

                                                                     
external energy can be minimized by allowing neighboring spins to diverge
somewhat from strict parallelism; these particles are referred to as <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">pseudo-single</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">domain </span>or PSD. Eventually, the spins organize themselves into regions with
quasi-uniform magnetization (magnetic domains) separated by domain walls and
are called <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">multi-domain </span>(MD) particles. These more complicated spin
structures are very difficult to model and most paleomagnetic theory is
based on the single domain approximation. Therefore we begin with
a discussion of the energies of uniformly magnetized (single-domain)
particles.

using the example of magnetite, a common magnetic mineral (Figure&#x00A0;<a

Magnetite octahedra (Figure&#x00A0;<a

cations and four O<sup><span

class="cmsy-8">-</span></sup> anions. Each oxygen anion shares an electron with two
neighboring cations in a covalent bond.
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >In Chapter 3 we mentioned that in some crystals, spins are aligned anti-parallel,
yet there is still a net magnetization, a phenomenon we called ferrimagnetism.
This can arise from the fact that not all cations have the same number of
unpaired spins. Magnetite, with its ferrous (4 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">m</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">b</span></sub>) and ferric (5 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">m</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">b</span></sub>) states is a
good example. There are three iron cations in a magnetite crystal giving a
total of 14 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">m</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">b</span></sub> to play with. Magnetite is very magnetic, but not that
magnetic! From Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-300011">4.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:magnetite --></a>b we see that the ferric ions all sit on the
tetrahedral (A) lattice sites and there are equal numbers of ferrous and ferric
ions sitting on the octahedral (B) lattice sites. The unpaired spins of
the cations in the A and B lattice sites are aligned anti-parallel to one
another because of superexchange (Chapter 3) so we have 9 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">m</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">b</span></sub> on the
B sites minus 5 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">m</span><sub><span

Single-domain particles have a quasi-uniform magnetization and the application
of a magnetic field does not change the net magnetization, which remains at
saturation (<span

toward the applied field. Yet the magnetizations in many particles do not rotate
freely toward the magnetic field (or we would not have paleomagnetism!).
There is another contribution to the energy of the magnetic particle
associated with the magnetic crystal itself. This energy depends on the
direction of magnetization in the crystal &#8211; it is anisotropic &#8211; and is called
<span

slightly distorted and becomes monoclinic instead of cubic. This transition

<!--l. 332--><p class="noindent" >So far we have been discussing hypothetical magnetic particles that are uniformly
magnetized. Particles with strong magnetizations (like magnetite) have self
energies that quickly become quite large because of the dependence on the square
of the magnetization. We have been learning about several mechanisms that tend
to align magnetic spins. In fact in very small particles of magnetite (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x003C; </span>40 nm),
the spins are essentially lined up. The particle is uniformly magnetized and we
called it single domain (SD). In larger particles (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>80 nm) the self energy exceeds
the other exchange and magnetocrystalline energies and crystals have distinctly
non-uniform states of magnetization.
<!--l. 335--><p class="noindent" >There are many strategies possible for magnetic particles to reduce self energy.
Numerical models (called <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">micromagnetic models</span>) can find internal magnetization
configurations that minimize the energies discussed in the preceding sections.
Micromagnetic simulations for magnetite particles (e.g. Schabes and Bertram,
1988) allow us to peer into the state of magnetization inside magnetic particles.
These simulations give a picture of increasing complexity from so-called <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">flower </span>to
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">vortex </span>(Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-360055">4.5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:nonuniform --></a>) remanent states. These particles share many properties of the
uniformly magnetized single domain particles and are called <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">pseudo-single</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">domain </span>(PSD) particles.
<!--l. 351--><p class="noindent" >As particles grow larger (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x003E;</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>200 nm), they break into multiple magnetic
domains, separated by narrow zones of rapidly changing spin directions called
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">domain walls</span>. Magnetic domains can take many forms. We illustrate a few in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-370026">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:domains --></a>. The uniform case (single domain) is shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-370026">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:domains --></a>a. The
external field is very large because the free poles are far apart (at opposite
ends of the particle). When the particle organizes itself into two domains
(Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-370026">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:domains --></a>b), the external field is reduced by about a factor of two. In the case
of four lamellar domains (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-370026">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:domains --></a>c), the external field is quite small. The
introduction of <span

href="#x6-370026">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:domains --></a>d reduces the external field to
nothing.

interaction between polarized light and the surface magnetic field of the target.
The light interacts with the magnetic field of the sample which causes
a small change in the light&#8217;s polarization and ellipticity. The changes
are detected by reflecting the light into nearly-crossed polarizers. The
longitudinal Kerr effect can show the alignment of magnetic moments in
the surface plane of the sample. Domains with different magnetization

scanning probe microscope that maps out the vertical component of the magnetic
fields produced by a highly polished section. The measurements are made with a
cantilevered magnetic tip that responds to the magnetic field of the sample. In
practice, the measurements are made in two passes. The first establishes the
topography of the sample (Figure&#x00A0;<a

raised slightly above the surface and by subtracting the topographic only signal
the attraction of the magnetic surface can be mapped (Figure&#x00A0;<a

particles that are for simplicity uniformly magnetized and dominated by
uniaxial anisotropy. Suppose that this block has some initial magnetization
<span

Anisotropy energy will tend to keep each tiny magnetic moment in its
original direction and the magnetization will not change over time. At
some temperature, certain grains will have sufficient energy to overcome
the anisotropy energy and flip their moments to the other easy axis.
As the energy surface is spherical, with no dimples or protruberances,
there is no preferred direction and, over time, the magnetic moments will
become random. Therefore, the magnetization as a function of time in this
simple scenario will decay to zero. The equation governing this decay
is:

There is a sharp transition between grains with virtually no stability

the field by a Langevin function (see Section&#x00A0;<a

<span

however, because the field required to saturate the moments is typically much
less than a tesla, whereas that for paramagnets can exceed hundreds of
tesla.

this chapter and make a plot of what sort of magnetic particles behave as
superparamagnets, which should be single domain and which should
be multi-domain according to our simple theories. We can estimate the
superparamagnetic to single domain threshold for magnetite as a function of
particle shape by finding for the length (2a) that gives a relaxation time of 100
seconds as a function of width to length ratio (<span

magnetite (heavy blue line in Figure&#x00A0;<a

Evans and McElhinny (1969) and Butler and Banerjee (1975). In this <span

<span

curve at which relaxation time is equal to 1 Gyr, reinforcing the point that very
small changes in crystal size and shape make profound differences in relaxation
time. The figure also predicts the boundary between the single domain
field and the two domain field, when the energy of a domain wall is less
than the self energy of a particle that is uniformly magnetized. This can
be done by evaluating wall energy with Equation&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-38002r9">4.9<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:wall --></a> for a wall along
the length of a parallelopiped and area (4<span

the wall energy is less than the self energy, we are in the two domain

<!--l. 538--><p class="noindent" >Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-3900411">4.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:butban --></a> suggests that there is virtually no SD stability field for equant
magnetite; particles are either SP or MD (multi-domain). As the width to length
decreases (the particle gets longer), the stability field for SD magnetite expands.
Of course micromagnetic modelling shows that there are several transitional
states between uniform magnetization (SD) and MD, i.e. the flower and vortex
remaent states (see Fabian et al., 1996), but Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-3900411">4.11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:butban --></a> has enormous predictive
power and the version of Butler and Banerjee (1975), (which is slightly
different in detail) continues to be used extensively. It is worth pointing out
however, that the size at which domain walls appear in magnetite is poorly
constrained because it depends critically on the exact shape of the particle, its
state of stress and even its history of exposure to past fields. Estimates
in the literature range from as small as 20 nm to much larger (up to
100 nm) depending on how the estimates are made. Nonetheless, it is
                                                                     

                                                                     
probably true that truly single domain magnetite is quite rare in nature, yet
more complicated states are difficult to treat theoretically. Therefore
most paleomagnetic studies rely on predictions made for single domain
particles.

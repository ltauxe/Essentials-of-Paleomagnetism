<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >The geological time scale is a list of ordered events placed in a temporal/spatial
context. Time is broken into Eons (e.g., Phanerozoic, Proterozoic), Eras (e.g.,
Mesozoic, Cenozoic), Periods (e.g., Cretaceus, Paleogene), Series (e.g, Oligocene,
Miocene) and Stages (e.g, Messinian, Zanclean). The fundamental unit, the stage,
is ideally defined by its base at a particular place and many such <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Global Standard</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Section and Points</span>, or GSSPs have been identified. Numerical ages are
attached to these stage boundaries by a variety of methods. Some methods
have explicit numerical age control (e.g., from the predictable decay of
radioactive isotopes or variations in climate caused by the relationship of the
Earth, the sun and the major planets), while others have only relative age
information (e.g., the progressive change of fossil assemblages, or the
identification of contemporaneous events in the geological record). Nmerical
ages are almost always estimated by correlation, interpolation, and/or
extrapolation. As such, the geological time scale is a work in constant
revision. The website of the International Stratigraphic Commission at
<a 
href="http://stratigraphy.org" class="url" ><span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">http://stratigraphy.org</span></a> has a wealth of information about ages, stages,
GSSPs, etc.
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >One of the important tools in assembling the geological time scale is the
geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS). Identification of a particular polarity
reversal allows direct correlation of isochronous events between continental
and marine sequences, between northern and southern hemispheres and
between the Pacific and Atlantic realms. Apart from the identification of
unique ash layers or the very rare geochemical tracers like an iridium
spike, there is no better way to tie together the stratigraphic record. In
fact, it is increasingly the case that stages are defined by certain polarity
intervals, as opposed to biostratigraphic information (see for example, the
definition of the Messinian Stage on the <a 
href="http://stratigraphy.org" class="url" ><span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">http://stratigraphy.org</span></a> website.)
In this chapter we will review how the modern GPTS was constructed
and will briefly consider some applications of the GPTS to geological
problems.

decay of radioactive potassium to argon) and polarity, from globally
distributed lava flows, that the first Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scales

polarity (i.e., field vector more or less parallel to today&#8217;s field) and times of
dominantly reverse polarity (i.e., field vector more or less antipodal to
today&#8217;s field). They called these time units &#8220;Epochs&#8221; (note that they are
now known as <span

major players in geomagnetism: B. Brunhes (who first discovered reversely
magnetized rocks), M. Matuyama (who first demonstrated that the reversely
magnetized rocks were older than the normal ones), and K.F. Gauss
(who worked out the first geomagnetic field model). A fourth was later
named after W. Gilbert (who first realized that the Earth itself was a
magnet). Cox et al. (1964) also recognized the existence of shorter intervals
which they called &#8220;Events&#8221; (e.g., the Olduvai and Mammoth events in

<!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >The publication of Cox et al. (1963) (see also McDougall and Tarling, 1963),
essentially laid to rest doubts about the validity of geomagnetic reversals and
sketched the rudiments of the first GPTS. Shortly thereafter, Vine and
Matthews (1963) put ideas about polarity reversals and the bizarre &#8220;magnetic
stripes&#8221; in marine magnetic anomaly data (e.g., Mason and Raff, 1961;
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x17-1850022">15.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:mason61 --></a>) together as strong support for the notion of sea floor spreading.
The realization that the marine magnetic anomalies were a record of
polarity history meant that the template for the pattern of reversals
could be extended far beyond the resolution of the K-Ar method. It was
not long before such a template for paleomagnetic reversals based on
magnetic anomalies (numbering 1 to 31) was proposed (e.g., Pitman and
Heirtzler 1966; see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x17-1850033">15.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pitman66 --></a>). By assigning an age of 0 Ma to the ridge
crest, an age of 3.35 Ma to the of the Gauss/Gilbert boundary (stars in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x17-1850033">15.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pitman66 --></a>) and assuming constant spreading for the South Atlantic anomaly
sequence, Heirtzler et al. (1968) extended the GPTS to about 80 Ma.
The age of anomaly 31 was estimated to be about 71.5 Ma. The truly
astounding thing is that the currently accepted age for anomaly 31 is
about 68 Ma (e.g., Cande and Kent, 1995) a difference of only a few
percent!

<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >By the early 70s the large scale structure of the marine magnetic anomalies had
been sketched out. There was a young set numbered 1-34 which terminated in a
vast expanse of oceanic crust with no correlatable anomalies known as the
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Cretaceous Quiet Zone </span>or CQZ. The Cretaceous Quiet Zone is well established as
being a period of time with very few (or no!) reversals (see Helsley and
Steiner, 1969). The CQZ is synonymous with the Cretaceous Normal
Superchron, or CNS and extends from the middle of the Santonian (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>
83 Ma; Cande and Kent, 1995) to the middle of the Aptian stage (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>
121 Ma; He et al., 2008). On the old end of the CQZ was another set of
anomalies, known as the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">M-sequence </span>(e.g., Larson and Heirtzler, 1972). These
extended from M0 (which bounds the old end of the CQZ) to M25 based on
easily recognizable marine magnetic anomalies. Unlike the younger set of
anomalies, the M-sequence anomalies are associated with reverse polarity
intervals.
<!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >Because the oldest sea floor is about 180 Ma and the oldest marine magnetic
anomaly sequences are very poorly expressed (a region known as the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Jurassic</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Quiet Zone</span>), polarity intervals older than about M29 were originally defined
using various magnetostratigraphic sections obtained from land exposures. The
M-squence of polarity intervals was extended to about M39 using sections from
Spain and Poland. The M-sequence has now been fairly firmly tied to
geological stages and thereby calibrated in terms of numerical ages (see
e.g., Channell et al. 1995). Recently, Tivey et al. (2006) bravely defined
marine magnetic anomalies back to M44 using deep-towed magnetometer
data and suggested that the JQZ was a time of extremely rapid polarity
reversals.
<!--l. 164--><p class="noindent" >As we go back farther in time, the GPTS necessarily becomes more sketchy.
Long sequences of stratigraphic sections are required with few gaps and
reasonably constant sediment accumulation rates. Such sequences are
difficult to identify and piece together so the GPTS will only slowly be
completed. Painstaking acquisition of overlapping stratigraphic sections
(see, e.g., Kent et al., 1995) will be the basis for future extensions of the

steadily.

<!--l. 185--><p class="nopar" >An interesting aspect to the magnetostratigraphic work typified by Opdyke et al.
(1966) was the identification of biostratigraphic zones (&#x03A9; to <span

href="#x17-1850044">15.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:opdyke66 --></a>)
based on faunal assemblages in the core. These zones are therefore tied directly
to the magnetostratigraphic record. The addition of biostratigraphy to the GPTS
brought new possibilities for the calibration of the time scale in that certain
boundaries could be dated by radioisotopic means using datable layers (e.g., ash
beds) within stratigraphic sections. If a particular well dated biostratigraphic
horizon could be tied to the magnetostratigraphic record, then the associated
numerical ages could be attached to the GPTS. Exploiting this possibility,
LaBrecque et al. (1977) used the magnetostratigraphic record in Italian
carbonates (e.g., Alvarez et al., 1977) which tied the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T)
boundary to a reverse polarity zone between two normal polarity intervals
correlated with marine magnetic anomalies 29 and 30. The accepted
age for the K/T boundary at the time was 65 Ma (van Hinte, 1976)
which is virtually identical to the currently accepted age of 65.5<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">± </span>0.3 Ma
(Gradstein et al., 2004), so ages for the anomalies numbered 1-34 could be
estimated by interpolation and extrapolation. Note that anomaly 14 is now
thought to be a cryptochron (S. Cande, pers. comm.) and has not been
included as a numbered anomaly in timescales since LaBrecque et al.
(1977).

<!--l. 221--><p class="nopar" >Until 1990, the GPTS was dated using numerical ages based on the decay of
radioactive elements (largely the K/Ar method). An alternative approach to
dating stratigraphic sequences long in use is based on the climatically induced
changes in lithology or stable isotopic records in sediments that are caused by
variations in the Earth&#8217;s orbit around the sun. The relationship of the
Earth&#8217;s orbit to the sun results in changes in the amount and latitudinal
distribution of solar radiation (<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">insolation</span>) reaching the Earth as a function of
time. According to the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Milankovitch hypothesis </span>(e.g., Hays et al. 1976),
changes in insolation at high northern latitudes vary with periodicities
reflecting precession (with a beat of around 21 kyr), obliquity (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~ </span>40 kyr)
and eccentricity (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~ </span>100 kyr). These changes in insolation resulted in
measurable changes in the chemistry of the oceans and atmospheres and left an
indelible mark on the lithostratigraphy (e.g., variations in carbonate) and
the isotopic ratios of oxygen (the light isotope <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">16</span></sup>O gets preferentially
incorporated into glacial ice at high latitudes, leaving the oceans richer
in <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">18</span></sup>O.) Because the precession, obliquity and eccentricity of Earth&#8217;s
orbit can be robustly predicted as a function of age at least for several
million years (and perhaps even 10s of millions of years &#8211; see Laskar et al.,
2004), identification of these patterns in the stratigraphic record allows
numerical ages to be attached to the sedimentary sequence. This is a
method known as <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">astrochronology</span>. Starting with Shackleton (1990) and
Hilgen (1991), astrochronology has been applied to the GPTS (see e.g.,
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x17-1850066">15.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hilgen91 --></a>).
<!--l. 230--><p class="noindent" >Astrochronology may be essential for extending the time scale back into deep
time. Using a series of drill cores with overlapping sections, Kent et al. (1995)
defined a set of polarity intervals labelled E1 to E23 (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x17-1860017">15.7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:newark --></a>). Kent and
Olsen (1999) interpreted lithologic cycles within sections as 400 kyr climatic
cycles and calibrated their composite depth scale to time. Their resulting time

<!--l. 243--><p class="nopar" >The Epoch/Event terminology was changed to Chron/sub-chron in 1979 by
                                                                     

                                                                     
international agreement (Anonymous, 1979). Along with chrons and sub-chrons,
the international subcommission defined <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">superchrons</span>. Cande and Kent (1992)
later defined <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">cryptochrons</span>. Superchrons are extremely long polarity intervals,
such as the Kiaman (also known as the Permo-Carbaniferous Reverse Superchron
or PCRS) which lasted from 298 to 265 Ma (Gradstein et al., 2004) and the
Cretaceous Normal Superchron (CNS: 83-121 Ma in Gee and Kent, 2007).
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Cryptochrons </span>are <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">tiny wiggles </span>in the marine magnetic anomaly record that are
too short to be unequivocally interpreted as full reversals (i.e., shorter than
about 30 kyr). Some of these may be related to geomagnetic excursions,
microchrons or just periods of low geomagnetic field strength (see Chapter
14.)
<!--l. 265--><p class="noindent" >In an attempt to &#8220;rationalize&#8221; the Neogene chron (event) terminology (which
numbered chrons from 5-22) and the anomaly terminology (running from 1 to
about 6C), Cande and Kent (1992) followed the convention of Tauxe et al. (1983)
and broke the time scale into chrons and sub-chrons based on the anomaly
numbering scheme distinguishing chrons from anomalies with the letter
&#8220;C&#8221;. The &#8220;C&#8221; stands for &#8220;Chron&#8221; and is meant to distinguish the time
unit from the anomaly. Because the anomaly numbering system only
had 34 anomalies from the end of the CNS to the present, many more
subdivisions were required, particularly in the very &#8220;busy&#8221; interval between
Anomalies 5 and 6. These anomalies were denoted 5&#8217;, 5A, 5AA, 5AB
and the like. For a complete listing of the current GPTS, please refer to
Table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x17-193001r1">15.1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:gpts --></a>. This is the time scale of Gee and Kent (2007) which is a
hybrid of the Cande and Kent (1995) and the Channell et al. (1995) time
scales with the addition of sub-chrons recognized by Lowrie and Kent
(2004).
<!--l. 281--><p class="noindent" >In the interval from 83 Ma to the present, the anomalies are associated with
normal polarity, so the chrons are designated C1n, C1r, C2n, C2r for the normal
associated with Anomaly 1 (the Brunhes), the dominantly reverse interval
between Anomaly 1 and Anomaly 2 (the Olduvai) and the dominantly reverse
interval between Anomalies 2 and 2A (the Gauss). There are many more
subchrons than this. For example, the Jaramillo and a little subchron known as
the Cobb Mountain are within subchron C1r. Subchrons can be further
subdivided; the Jaramillo is now known as C1r.1n. And it gets worse. A
cryptochrons is designated with a &#8220;-&#8221; after the subchron within which it
lies. One such, the Cobb Mountain excursion(1.201-1.211 Ma) is labelled
C1r.2r-1n in the most recent time scale. Because of the complexity of the
anomaly-based naming scheme, and the continous discovery of new features,
the GPTS has become a nightmare of chron and sub-chron names like
                                                                     

                                                                     
C5r.2r-2n or C5ADr where the &#8220;n&#8221;s and &#8220;r&#8221;s refer to polarity and the &#8220;.1&#8221;s,
&#8220;.2&#8221;s and so on refer to the sub-chrons within chrons (e.g, C4n). The
C5r.2r-2n is, for example, the second normal cryptochron within the second
reverse polarity sub-chron of Chron C5r. The M-sequence names follow on
from the younger chrons. The youngest of these is therefore CM0r (see

<!--l. 302--><p class="nopar" >An important application of having a time scale of geomagnetic polarity reversals
is as a dating tool for stratigraphic sequences. The pattern of polarity zones is
determined by measuring the magnetization of samples taken from the
stratigraphic section. If the polarity zones in the so-called <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">magnetostratigraphy</span>
can be unambiguously correlated to the GPTS, they constitute a precise
temporal framework for sedimentary or volcanic sequences. Such records have
proved invaluable for correlating stratigraphic information on a global basis and
are the primary means for calibrating the Cenozoic fossil record with respect to
time. Furthermore, knowing the ages of polarity reversals allows the calculation
of rates of processes such as sea-floor spreading, sediment accumulation,
extinctions and speciation and provides independent verification of orbital
calculations.
<!--l. 319--><p class="noindent" >Sedimentation is not always a continuous process in many environments
and a stratigraphic section may have gaps of significant duration. Also,
the magnetic recording process of the rock may be unreliable over all
or part of the section. Furthermore, incomplete sampling may give a
polarity log that is undersampled. For these reasons, there must be ways of
establishing the reliability of a given polarity sequence and the robustness of
a given correlation. For a more complete discussion of the subject of
magnetostratigraphy, the reader is referred to the comprehensive book by
Opdyke and Channell (1996) entitled <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Magnetic Stratigraphy</span>. Briefly, the
elements of a good magnetostratigraphic study include the following
points.
<!--l. 335--><p class="noindent" >

     three to five separately oriented samples) with coherent directions (i.e.,
     non-random by tests such as those discussed in Chapter 11) indicate
     that the magnetization at a given level is reproducible. While it is not
     always possible to take multiple samples (for example from limited
     drill core material), it is alway desirable and certainly should be done
     whenever possible.

     and the paleomagnetic inclination is the only indicator of polarity. In
     this case, one can plot histograms of the inclination and establish that
     the two polarities (positive and negative) have discrete modes at the
     values expected for the site (paleo)latitude.

     (the  GAD  field;  see  Chapter  2),  and  the  expected  direction  based
     on the age of the formation for the sampling location. This can be
     done using Fisher statistics or a bootstrap as described in Chapters
     11 and 12, depending on the characteristics of the set of directions.
     Overprinting in the present field direction might be suspected if the
     directions cannot be distinguished from the present field direction.

<!--l. 399--><p class="nopar" >One very useful application of the GPTS is to infer rates of spreading, sediment
accumulation, etc. We illustrate this approach in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x17-1890019">15.9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:spreadingrate --></a>. Distance from the
ridge crest of each identified anomaly is plotted against age. The standard GPTS
based on the work of Cande and Kent (1992) built smooth changes in
spreading rate into the GPTS itself. A newer version of the Neogene
geomagnetic polarity time scale (see Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x17-1860028">15.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:neogene --></a>) published by Lourens et al.
(2004) in Gradstein et al. (2004) did not have this constraint because
much of it was calibrated using astrochronological methods. As a result
there are sharp changes in spreading rate implied, which could well be
artifacts of the method of calibration. Because of this behavior, we have
reverted to the time scale of Cande and Kent (1995; see Table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x17-193001r1">15.1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:gpts --></a>).
Future time scales will likely be calibrated using some balance between
astrochronology, smooth variations in spreading rate and radioisotopic
methods.

<!--l. 403--><p class="nopar" >Most magnetostratigraphic applications involve determination of a
magnetostratigraphy through a stratigraphic sequence of sediments. Because
polarity transitions occur relatively rapidly, the horizon bounding two polarity
zones may represent an almost isochronous level. It is therefore possible to use
magnetostratigraphy in a lateral sense, in order to delineate isochronous horizons
within a given package of sediments (Behrensmeyer and Tauxe. 1982). In
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x17-19101510">15.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:isochron --></a>, we show the application of magnetostratigraphy for tracing
isochrons in a series of stratigraphic sections. The small sand body (darker gray)
labeled &#8220;A&#8221; appears to have removed the normal polarity zone seen in sequences
on the right of the figure either by erosion or because of unsuitable paleomagnetic
properties of sand. Sand bodies B and C appear to represent quasi-isochronous
horizons.

nannofossils in the core suggest an Oligocene age. Download the SmartBook and
unzip the downloaded archive. Change directory into the tauxe-and-hartl1997

with that expected value? What might cause of any discrepancies you
observe?
